{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":18,"selftext":"Quite a number of people have come out and said their local banks refuse to do business with them if they mention or have ties to anything crypto. I too have encountered this issue and this is how I overcame it.\n\n# Fiat On-Ramping\n\nFirstly, you may have had your VISA\/Mastercard cards blocked if you try to make puchases on any crypto-related site. Your bank should allow you to connect your card to Paypal. If you are able doing this,you may then use Paxful to make buy\/sell crypto on their P2P market. You can have the merchant use their Paypal to send a payment request to your email\/phone number. When done you will receive a request and clicking the link will take you to a page where you can send money directly from your card. \n\nBeware: using a credit card as opposed to a debit card will attract a fairly high cash advance fee of maybe 3% depending on your bank. This is on top of any currency conversion fees and domestic\/international payment fees Paypal may charge as well as the card issuer international transaction fees and bank fees. But it's better than nothing. For myself, these fees come up to around 6% domestic and 9% international, but my region is the most expensive for all Paypal fees. Your mileage may vary.\n\nYou may also use Binance or Kucoin(no KYC) or even MEXC P2P which allows many payment options such as Wise, ADVCash, Perfect Money, Zelle, AirTm and many others(MEXC doesn't have all these payment options). You can go to Binance and Kucoin(requires no KYC) to see the various payment options .You may also google crypto P2P exchanges with or without KYC depending on your needs. Instead of Paypal, if your bank allows it, you may connect your card to transfer funds to an account on any of these \"E-Wallet\" sites(Wise, Perfect Money ADVCash etc). After transferring funds, you can then use the P2P exchanges of Kucoin or Binance or MEXC and transfer payments using these E-wallet sites as a medium to pay from your p2p crypto exchange. \n\nBeware: your bank may also block card transactions with these e-wallet sites as well like mine does so you may need to defer to the strictly Paypal-only method I mentioned above using Paxful(which requires KYC). Some of these sites may be blocked for you, other may not or they all may be. You mileage may vary.\n\nIf your card is not blocked, you should be able to directly and easily buy at many crypto exchanges easily.\n\n# Fiat Off-Ramping\n\nYou may have another issue of receiving payments. Your bank may not want to accept payments directly from a crypto exchange. For this we again have to get cunning. You will again need an intermediary to send your crypto funds to, from which you may send to your bank *if even necessary.*\n\nOf the top of my head I can only think of two online bank options:Wise(as mentioned before) and Bankera. Now Wise only allows you to withdraw fiat(wire transfer) from a crypto exchange to Wise but you cannot deposit from Wise to an crypto exchange. Additionally they only allow deposits from UK regulated exchanges like Kraken, FTX so you should be okay with the bigger exchanges. I believe Bankera allows transfers both ways and is very crypto friendly. \n\nThis is not an exhaustive list of fiat off-ramps as many of the many payment options on Binance P2P probably open up other avenues. For example like Perfect Money that only allows for transactions from one of their certified exchange partners. I don't want to speak too much on it because I'm not the most familiar with Perfect Money. \n\nThe good news is that both of these online banks(Wise and Bankera) offer debit cards such that *if you are a resident where the card if offered* you can receive this card and use it for all your payments or purchases. You'd hardly even need to wire transfer back to your local banks, although I can speak to how reliable the card itself may be. For Bankera in particular, even if you are not a resident, if you know the address of a friend\/family who does like in a region where it is offered you can have them ship the card there(as far as I was told anyway).\n\nIf you do need to send back to  your local bank, Wise will probably be accepted as it is well-recognized in the financial world and is UK and US regulated. Bankera *should* be accepted as it is regulated in Lithuania in the EU. I must also speak to Bankera and I can't say too much about their credibility as they seemed to have had some issues in the past but if necessary you can simply keep little or only as much on Bankera as you need to for as little time as possible, simply only sending funds there that you need immediate access to.\n\nYou may also choose to connect your online bank account of Bankera or Wise to your Paypal to send funds between them, for example if you want to connect your card to Paypal and send funds received from a paypal exchange back to your card. \n\nCheers all. Happy trading.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/xtyw8y\/psa_to_everyone_whose_banks_wont_allow_them\/","author":"OneThatNoseOne","num_comments":36,"created_utc":1664742405000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ADVICE","title":"PSA To Everyone Whose Banks Won't Allow Them Access To Crypto","distinguished":null,"id":"xtyw8y","downs":null,"ups":null}

Crypto Marketcap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares issued by the share price. Its use as a measure of total value is now applied to bonds, commodities, and cryptocurrencies using the same formula. The marketcap dominance is simply the percentage of the total marketcap that a particular crypto holds.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":28,"selftext":"I got into bitcoin back when it was $5. I bought thousands of USD worth of bitcoin at this time. I bought hundreds of dollars worth of dogecoin almost a decade ago now. I'm broke. Why? Because my security and practices at holding\/storing crypto were mediocre. \n\nI now believe it doesn't matter how much crypto you have if you're not enacting the BEST practices because you're going to lose it. \n\nI'm going to explain exactly what I do now and feel free to chime in if you have anything to add. Combining all of this is very important because the chances of you getting hacked, losing a seed phrase, reformatting your pc, etc are very high. Exchanges also get hacked.\n\nEvery exchange I used when I first got into crypto is gone and most ran with all the money.\n\n**Hot\/Cold Wallets**\n\nUse multiple wallets. Hot wallets are for actually using the blockchain. Cold wallets are for storing things. When you need to buy something move money to your hot wallet. \n\nWhen you buy an NFT use your hot wallet. \n\nBuying some coin on a dex? Hot wallet.\n\nYour cold wallet should ideally be a hardware wallet and should never interact with any contract. Just do simple transfers. This will save you from getting exploited. Especially on EVM based chains bad actors can add code to seemingly innocuous contracts and functions.\n\n**Hardware Wallet**\n\nUse a hardware wallet. This gives you a physical layer of security. You HAVE to physically interact with the wallet to ok a transaction. This is a great investment. No one can remotely control your computer with a trojan and steal your money unless you ok it on your ledger.\n\nMake sure you buy a ledger or trezor directly from the vendor or maybe their official Amazon store.\n\nIf your seed phrase gets compromised anyone can steal everything on your hardware wallet btw. So it's really only as secure as your seed phrase. Think of a hardware wallet as a key to unlock your crypto which is on the blockchain. It's not actually stored on your hardware wallet. Your seed phrase generates this key and is something you can never lose or share no matter what.\n\n**Backup your Seed!!**\n\nThis is important. Eventually your computer will go corrupt. Someone will clean your room and donate your ledger thinking it's some outdated USB storage stick. This literally happened to me several months ago when I was doing construction in my computer room (I got it back and didn't lose anything).\n\n100% make sure your seed phrase is backed up. Not just in one place but in multiple places. What you can do is use a cypher to protect your seed. Now people can't steal it even if they find your written seed.\n\nWhat I did was translate each seed phrase into a number based on https:\/\/coldti.com\/coldti-bip39.pdf\n\nThen I performed Modulus 3 on every word and wrote the number. This divides the number by three and throws away the remainder. I then sent the remainders to myself and backed them up on several places online. Now if someone finds my seed and somehow figures out what I did there are 3^24 combinations to crack it. This will stop 99.9% of people. \n\n**Save your Seed in Metal**\n\nBuy a cheap titanium seed kit on amazon. I hammered my seed phrases into titanium and hid them at my parent's houses. Again I used the modulus 3 basic cypher I described and put the remainders on a cloud service. This is important because you want backups in multiple locations. There can be fires. Robberies. Floods. You need something tough.\n\n**Seed phrase and private key security**\n\nAbsolutely try to avoid ever typing your seed phrase or copying and pasting it on any device that is or will be online. Never send it to yourself in email. Never encrypt it with a commonly used password and store it on dropbox.\n\nA decade ago I lost all my dogecoin because I copied and pasted my private key. Turned out there was malware that instantly detected it and emptied out my address. That was a decade ago. Imagine how advanced this stuff is now.\n\n**Don't get greedy with APRs. Only use the safest Exchanges**\n\nPeople get greedy with yield. They'll throw everything on some new exchange giving 5-10% interest. It doesn't matter how much interest you get if the exchange gets hacked or steals everything. Literally every exchange I used years ago is gone. Assume that'll happen to every exchange we have today. I would guess Binance, FTX, and Kucoin are safe right now but who knows. Ideally you should store all your stuff on a cold wallet which is a hardware wallet.\n\n**Don't hold bridged assets**\nMany people don't realize when they're holding bridged tokens. These are tokens that may represent Ethereum on Binance smart chain for example. They're worth 1:1 with ethereum because this bridge holds one eth for every one BSC eth. These bridges are constantly hacked and holding assets from them is very high risk. It's safer to use an exchange like kucoin and sell assets and buy the asset on it's chain of origin. Hold eth on eth chain. Hold BNB on Binance smart chain. Hold Solana on Solana chain. \n\nRonin bridge, harmony, binance and many others have been hacked for billions at this point. Holding these assets is incredibly high risk.\n\n\nAny other tips?\n\n**edit: Some people are not believing that I was an early bitcoin person. The truth is that I 100% was. Here are some old emails of bitcoin purchases I made.**\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/MXE5mbt\n\nI fucked up and because of that I'm here and living in a studio apartment.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":1,"selftext":"People will frequently talk about how crypto can't really be mainstream until the wallets and addresses are less arcane for non-technical people, and where people don't need to worry about losing their keys or their whole balance for silly reasons.  We already see some of this in terms of exchanges, but at what point will the underlying blockchain be so abstracted away that it doesn't even matter that there is a transparent and open ledger, e.g. everything is conducted via IOUs on exchanges and the like, leaving people with no records, no custody, and no recourse.  Obviously, the cheapest and most user friendly way to use crypto is to never use an actual wallet or blockchain but just do everything on a centralized service (which to be fair is how most people start off).  There's also been examples of \"crypto companies\" developing an open and permissionless system but then double dipping and developing closed blockchains for governments, which seems to be entirely against the ethos.\n\nOther examples include the centralization of stablecoins, allowing easily-regulated\/pressured entities to be in charge of what chains and even transactions they support.  Feeding into and off of this, Vitalik has talked about centralization concerns in terms of validators enforcing censorship at the blockchain level.  A few people (I believe both Vitalik and SBF) have voiced concerns about how crypto on exchanges is effectively funny money, as there's no real transparency as to them not \"creating\" coins or operating on IOUs, completely separate from the blockchain, at which point why have the blockchain at all?  It seems like there will come a time when most of crypto is packaged, commercialized, and made palatable for the benefit of Wall Street and governments, abandoning the original ethos of individual freedom and sovereignty.  There just seem to be a number of issues that are non-technical in nature, that aren't things we can necessarily code our way out of, but still pose significant threats to the ethos of crypto, even if it is \"good\" for the price.\n\nYou could of course say that BTC has already deviated from Satoshi's original intentions, but I would say that it generally holds the torch still, and the core BTC community is still based around avoiding the reckless debasement of fiat, sovereignty of money \/ individual's property, and in general the guiding principals still hold even if upgrades\/implementations have gone in a different direction.  As BTC (and crypto in general) continues to grow, it seems like it will continue to be watered down, preserving only the NGU mindset and if we are lucky, maybe retaining the fiat debasement avoidance narrative.  I think you would be relatively hard pressed to say that 5 years from now crypto won't be more centralized, more controlled by intuitions and financial instruments (e.g. derivatives), more amenable to censorship in order to appease said institutions, all of which I believe are consequences of or arguably even necessary in order to achieve mainstream adoption.\n\nDoes anyone have examples of something which was created to fix a problem and spawned a movement, went mainstream, but did not lose its integrity? I'm also fairly involved with Linux and there is also a pretty unmistakable trend there of moving away from compiling everything yourself and rather is shifting more towards relying on centralized or non-free alternatives that can offer \"better\" user-friendliness, essentially co-opting large aspects of the movement as more and more people choose to use the \"corporate\" alternatives instead of the free software that started everything.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/xy80u1\/going_mainstream_without_comprising_original\/","author":"Amun-Aion","num_comments":16,"created_utc":1665171152000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"Going mainstream without comprising original principles?","distinguished":null,"id":"xy80u1","downs":null,"ups":null}

This 2022 bear market, the feeling is different for most people; what unites is now is a strong belief that crypto *will* prevail on the longterm, despite the fact that we are 70% down and this is the first time we experience a true global financial crisis.\n\nJust how bright the future is for crypto is evidenced by all the mainstream adoption that we are seeing during a bear market (!).

This year has not exactly been a great year for Kraken as it has made headlines in the US not so hot reasons. When news came out yesterday that the company Payward had made a pretty significant political donation it was something that made me do a double take. With the Chairman of the Board and temporary CEO, Jesse Powell, having been in the spotlight in recent months over the controversy\u2019s he has caused to me made this donation all the more interesting. This election cycle the other donation was from January and was to Miami for Everyone. This is a PAC in the area that that is aligned with the Mayor who has been huge in bringing Bitcoin and blockchain to his city. Given the allegations that he has created a hateful workplace along with the Treasury Department investigation into allowing individuals from sanctioned countries to use their exchange to buy and sell digital tokens it is a little bit surprising. \n\n\nThe company donated $100,000 to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis\u2019 reelection campaign. Given that the company is not very active in the state it has struck people as odd however working in Washington, DC it makes a ton of sense to me. With the 2024 Presidential election going to be an interesting and complicated time for the country starting to donate to a possible Presidential nominee early makes a ton of sense. It could also help the company and Powell out as well during the investigation that is taking place and with any future ones as well. Also it should be noted the DeSantis campaign is not exactly hurting for cash with over $100 million in the bank while his opponent only has $1.6 million. \n\nForming connections with influential politicians is key for emerging companies and industries like DeSantis is. We have already seen SBF invest heavily in this election cycle and I am sure in a presidential one he would invest even more. This shows others in the space and looking at this as well.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/y51vts\/payward_ceos_interesting_political_donation\/","author":"Status_Floor1746","num_comments":31,"created_utc":1665876804000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"Payward CEO\u2019s Interesting Political Donation","distinguished":null,"id":"y51vts","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":9,"selftext":"Yesterday I saw an article discussing the drama\/snag that has hit the Voyager deal. This deal was supposed to close officially on Wednesday but now that might be up in the air. Two different Texas authorities, the Texas State Securities Board (TSSB) and the Texas Department of Banking (DOB), have filed notice that they [oppose the Voyager Digital disclosure statement](https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/texas-authorities-object-to-voyager-s-disclosure-statement-in-its-current-form) as they claim the methodology used to calculate the coin prices is not disclosed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince Texas has been extremely supportive of crypto and blockchain technology even allowing State Chartered banks to hold Bitcoin themselves this did not make the most sense. However, the more that I looked into it the more it started to make sense to me. An underlying issue that both Voyager and FTX face is that neither is [licensed to operate in Texas](https:\/\/twitter.com\/fintechfrank\/status\/1582032079289667586) with Voyager already facing large fines from not only Texas but other states as well. This follows in the same vein as when the SSB and DOB along with Vermont's Department of Financial Regulation objected to Celsius selling off some of its stablecoin holdings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile the state wanting to see how the company concluded that creditors might get 70% of their holdings returned to them is the biggest thing objection there was another key issue that I have not seen anyone yet address. Voyager has been sent cease and desist letters from multiple states for their Voyager Earn Program and while FTX.US does not have an Earn program FTX does and through the FTX.US app, [you can move your funds to the FTX earn platform despite not being licensed in the US](https:\/\/help.ftx.us\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/9081464675735-FTX-Earn). In the argument for this objection, the [Director of TSSB](https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/policy\/2022\/10\/17\/crypto-exchange-ftx-us-under-investigation-by-texas-regulator-over-securities-allegations\/) documented how he was able to do it on his phone when it was brought to his attention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the plus side, FTX has since come out and said that they have been in [talks with Texas along with other states](https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/policy\/2022\/10\/17\/crypto-exchange-ftx-us-under-investigation-by-texas-regulator-over-securities-allegations\/) about their programs since if you run afoul of Texas financial laws it is highly highly likely you will with many other states. If you are wondering why Texas would throw a wrench like this into the proceeding it is highly likely that FTX was either not budging on something or was dragging its feet. Rather than open up a whole new court case against them, it was easier to tack this on to the Voyager one. I would be shocked if this was not resolved quickly as Texas wants to maintain its pro-crypto outlook and FTX doesn't want to be bogged down by increasing court fees. Ideally, they will just license FTX.US for their Earn program but as of now, that is unclear.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/y6jgb8\/voyager_sale_to_ftx_hits_a_snag\/","author":"Status_Floor1746","num_comments":2,"created_utc":1666033273000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"Voyager Sale to FTX Hits a Snag","distinguished":null,"id":"y6jgb8","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":0,"selftext":"Here I will have two of the foremost subs of Reddit facing off to see who has the better token. I'll try to conduct this in as fair a manner as possible to see which token provides better value to each community. I've obtained data directly from the mods and\/or sources official endorsed by the mods for Moons. For SafeMoon I'll try to use their own website as primary sources as much as possible. Here we go.\n\nInception and Team\n\nSafemooon was created in March 2021 by John Karony, either alone or possibly among other founders who are either unknown or no longer with the team. The token had apparently no utility, at least nothing more than a investment with a hopeful increase in value, and no team when it was launched as stated by media. Between March and April of 2021, SafeMoon increased in value by about 1300% to it's ath since it's launch price, following celebrity endorsements from musicians Lil' Yachty and Nick Carter, YouTuber(\/boxer?) Logan Paul, social media hype, new exchange listings, and retail investors.  The price quickly declined massively afterward and never came close to this ath value again. This has lead to many allegations of Safemoon as a ponzi scheme. These celebrities were later sued by many Safemoon investors as part of a  class-action lawsuit branding Safemoon to be a part of a pump and dump scheme.\n\nIt should be noted that many tokens release with little utility, for the good ones anyway, this is quickly followed by hard updates and upgrade following a roadmap of proposed implemented functionality or business dealings. Safemoon 2021 roadmap consisted as the following which I must admit doesn't involve much token functionality additions at least for 2021. 2022 seems to be a bit different on terms of *proposed* utility at least.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mefjpbdczru91.png?width=409&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba329c3b7458f29e887efaa98509e276668260bf\n\nMoons are implemented in June 2020 through work with the sub mods and a dev team and is as a community token through and though. They were originally launched on Rinkeby testnet with the plan to migrate over to the Ethereum Mainnet. Reddit partnered with the Ethereum Foundation in February 2021 to develop an open-sourced scaling solution for Moons. Tokens are created only insofar as users of the subreddit earn them by post content that other sub member appreciate enough to upvote(or not downvote). Admittedly, this could be seen as incentivizing an echo-chamber but this is something sub members are aware of and constantly call each other out on such as with the phrase \"no one knows sh\\*t about f\\*\\*k\". Rather poetic if I do say so myself.\n\nThe tokens started off on a testnet and required a fair bit of shenanigans to be sold like switching from BSC and xDai etc etc. Fair to say that it would be difficult to title moons as anything close to a pump and dump or ponzi. Perhaps the only knock is that the dev team is anaymous as far as the community is concerned. This is however quite common in the crypto space and is *almost* hardly even worth a mention as a disadvantage although individuals do generally prefer to know project devs.\n\nTokenomics\n\nSafemoon was deployed on the BSC network and has gone from version 1 to a version at the very end of 2021. It instituted a 100% tax on Safemoon V1 such that anyone who transfer tokens, mistakenly or otherwise, would lose **all** ***their tokens.*** It also currently has a 10% buy\/sell fee and a 2% transaction fee. There was also a 1:1000 Token Consolidation meaning simply token amounts per wallet were decrease by a factor of 1000 on SM v2. This no doubt goes a long way bolstering its ponzi reputation.\n\nTheir [Certik audit](https:\/\/investorplace.com\/2021\/05\/safemoon-audit-9-things-to-know-about-the-safemoon-certik-findings\/) found over a dozen issues, a \"major issue\" that the project's owners have \"control over tokens funded by SafeMoon's seller fee\". They are also listed on a number of exchanges like Bitrue and KickEX. Safemoon max supply stands at 1 trillion tokens making the circulating supply a bit over 56% of the limit.\n\nMoons are deployed on Arbitrum Nova which has seen its fair share of controversy and possibly rightfully so. This is a new chain with really only literally a handful of other tokens on it as well. If you receive moons you'll have to somehow find a way to get ETH onto Nova, either through some cross chain bridge or from one of the few very cex's support Nova like FTX. Outside of dexes of RCPSwap and Sushiswap, only Gate io and MEXC cex's support moons trading. An upside is that Nova gas fees are extremely low.\n\nMoons are not audited as far as I was made aware. They are distributed each month based community points earned from user submission and sub engagement with with submission. Governance polls are used to determine how much moons are distributed per submission. Round 1 of issuance began in June 2020 with 5,000,000 total Moons  available for distribution. The monthly distribution is on a  predetermined schedule that drops a fixed 2.5% each round until eventually moons distribution will reach a steady state where the total supply continues to grow at 1% a year.\n\nUtility\n\nIn truth and in fact, Safemoon really doesn't seem to have any utility at all. I struggled at this point to make a fair comparison but there really seems to be nothing for this section. It is not quite fair to state *proposed* utility so take the following with a full ladle of salt.\n\nSince the early half of 2021, Safemoon had proposed a Safemoon card on the Mastercard network to be implemented by October 2021. There has been nothing concrete as of yet. The proposed plans also had a 2.5% fee for use. Credit to [u\/KeepIt2Virgils](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/KeepIt2Virgils\/) for this chart of the proposed Safemoon card compared with the market. According to this, the SM card would easily be the worst on the market assuming they went ahead with no cashback rewards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ho1oefffzru91.png?width=813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb098405c5c4d3efd9f588d6a52017ea24880d4d\n\nThey have also more recent announced plans of a Safemoon exchange. There have been screenshots and leaked videos of an apparent beta build of the exchange but we have no idea if or when the finished product will be released, or if the whole thing was just fake window dressing. Who is to say. There is also some unclear staking functionality on Safemoon Wallet for their token but when you tokemonics has a 10% sell fee and 2% transfer fee...what gains are you really left with?\n\nMoons, as a community token are used to add value and provide functionality to the subreddit r\/CryptoCurrency. They are used to incentivize and reward quality posts and submitters. They are also used in governance polls to determine to future state of the subreddit. Moons can be tipped between users, redeemed for Reddit coins, or used to purchase special sub membership. Moons are burned when users buy the premium membership or redeem Moons for Reddit coins. Each round half of the Moons burned during the previous distribution cycle are reintroduced. Moons may also be used with dapps on the blockchain itself although aside from RCPSwap there hasn't yet been much (public) development in the area.\n\nTrading Statistics\n\nSafemoon has a market cap of $309,483,847. It's 24h volume at the time of writing is $1,796. A good measure for a fair comparison of trading value is Volume\/market cap, which stands at 0.00000577.\n\nMoons has a market cap of $10,268,177. It's 24h volume at the time of writing is $189,289. Its Volume\/market cap, which stands at 0.01838.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConclusion\n\nI think it's fair to say that in almost every regard Moons are better than Safemoon. Admittedly this may be a somewhat biased but I cannot see how it could be otherwise. Of particular note to me is the fact that even though Safemoon has a much *higher* market cap by almost 30x, it's current 24hr trade volume *lower* by a factor of 100x, making its Volume\/market cap lower by 3000x.\n\n*No I won't state any info on John Karony suing his mother as I don't believe that should have bearing on the quality of the project itself. There's too much speculation on the reality of that point anyway. You however may look into it yourself if you like.*","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/y84sgd\/the_ultimate_battle_moons_vs_safemoon\/","author":"OneThatNoseOne","num_comments":38,"created_utc":1666191158000,"edited":1666218942000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANALYSIS","title":"The Ultimate Battle - Moons vs SafeMoon","distinguished":null,"id":"y84sgd","downs":null,"ups":null}

It sends orders and accesses customer information the same way other users do, he added.                 \n\nAdding to that, there's been a shift in leadership at Alameda:\n\n&gt;\u201cWe\u2019re arm\u2019s length and don\u2019t get any different treatment from other market makers,\u201d said Ellison, who\u2019s leading Alameda following the departure of co-CEO  Sam Trabucco last month.               \n\nAlameda provides liquidty at an institutional level for FTX. Let's stop and think about what that means. You have lots of money, How do you make more money with that money? I'll explain below...                \n\nYou own a bank. Your bank has 1000 USD of Actual liquidity. You have ten customers and more and more are signing up each day. Each customer has 150 USD (1500 USD total in your bank). We all know the majority of money at a bank is just numbers on a screen and not actual cash. All of your customers at your bank want to send money to Bob's bank. Each customer wants to send 110 USD (1100 USD total). That puts your bank in negative balance \/ insolvent territory. So you sign with a 3rd party bank that can provide liquidity that then goes to bob's bank in exchange for a small fee for each transaction. Your bank transfers funds to bob's bank using the 3rd party bank for a small fee. Those dollars don't actually move, but they get credited.                   \n\nThe above may sound complicated, but so far as I know that is the extent of the relationship between Alameda and FTX. Nothing more, nothing less.                \n\nMy take is that the legislation he is pushing for is meant to allow government to hold companies like FTX and Alameda accountable and prevent people from being harmed. \n\n**I would also like to point out that people who are pointing to Bitboy Crypto as a news source \/ [\"confirmation source\"](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Rky4aOB) without revealing who is sources are or what they are actually talking about - these people are not doing anyone here any favors. I could just as easily say, \"I just got double, triple confirmation that binance is going to list this or that coin next week.\" for clout.\"**                  \n\nTL;DR - people are hysterical that a billionaire's business partners do shady business while doing legit business with FTX.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":0,"selftext":"I'm kinda lost here tbh. The list doesn't look good. To clear it immediately, yes, Defi is an option but many users especially newbies are either not willing or able to accept that responsibility or pay Defi's higher fees. But for the purpose of this post, I am only looking at Cefi.\n\n**Coinbase** isn't available fully globally for one. But also, they threatened to sue customers who profited from their *own* glitch. They have also suffered from outages and have very poor customer support from what users say. At least in the past many people have also complained about accounts being randomly closed with no resolution.\n\n**Binance** also has questionable customer support and people have been turning to the Binance sub as they are only taken seriously when complaining in a public forum. There was one particular mod there who seems to be a lifesaver as the last and only source of assistance to Binance users. I don't know if he's still around but I hope so. They have been\/are involved with a lot of regulation lawsuits and issue due to not following respective jurisdiction laws. There were also reports of Binance attempting to skirt US regulations while publicly supporting it. We have also seen the true colours of CZ with the centralization of the Binance token meanwhile CZ tweets away recklessly about the apparently negativity of centralization and control.\n\n**Kucoin**...I don't even know if I need to go into this. Just very bad customer service all around and bad trading service in general like user's positions being randomly closed(apparently due to maintenance) and them being entitled to refunds but not receiving them. A few weeks ago, Kucoin also had some SMS scam which had to be an inside job where many users received fradulent texts to their cellphones apparently from Kucoin. Also many reports of accounts being closed supposedly randomly. There are many bugs on the site like the try to roll out many features many of the features even the basic necessary ones just don't work well. There were also many reports of users clipboard(copy\/paste data) being stolen on the mobile app. There were also reports of some of user's transation history disappearing. Of course, I can't speak to the validity of *all* these claims but they are all so pervasive when you look for reviews that it is hard to ignore. Sure some get through using Kucoin with no issues but they seem to be the exceptions and not the rule.\n\n**Crypto.com** I don't know if I need to go into the heavy card rewards slashing as it's fairly well known by now, which they only slightly improved rewards after users complained. I don't know if the 10 mil they sent to the Australian woman due to a \"manual spreadsheet mistake\" and only realized 7 months later *after laying off thousands of staff* and then later suing the woman, if they counts as an exchange complaint. They also have very high spreads as well as fees in general. Tho I have heard their customer service to be pretty good at least. But they generally seem way more oriented to marketing and expanding as much as possible as opposed to customer satisfaction.\n\n**Gate IO** is strange. There aren't *that* many reviews and they seem mixed. I really don't know if it's user error or the exchange but there are reports of lots of inaccessible funds. The consensus at least seems to be that it's management is just not the best as it's run by a small team in China. What I can say is they listed moons and were forced to *re-list* moons after they sent moons to the wrong address and lost a bunch of them apparently. As a moon holder I'm glad for the burn but that poor management turned me off immediately.\n\n**Huobi** seems pretty similar to the negativity of Kucoin. In some ways better, others worse.\n\n**FTX** is such a sad case because it seems like a pretty decent exchange but knowing SBF is behind is it just sours everything. I mean the exchange seems to work fine for now but we just never know what SBF will try. He's has been acquiring companies left and right and has also made anti-decentralization statements. Also, there were recent reports of him bullying DAO's and projects into using FTX for listing. If you're extremely cynical you could maybe think(*maybe* more like fool) yourself into thinking that well FTX just wants more customers and profits so if you're already using FTX you're okay and they won't screw you. Btw, full disclosure I use FTX but seriously having second thoughts and I don't think I really wanna support SBF so if I sound like an FTX apologist that would be why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow the only exchanges I can vouch for are **Kraken and MEXC** probably. Kraken is just bloody good all-round. The customer service is so good I actually feel harassed by them. It feels kinda overbearing at this point but that might just go to show how low the bar is\/was. Their only \"issue\" might be if you're into using leverage they only offer up to 5x leverage spot and 50x for futures and their token list is pretty small relatively. Of course smaller leverage is better for most traders who go all in and wreck themselves so it's hardly an issue I think.\n\nAbout MEXC I'm very surprised I haven't heard about them before. They seem to have fairly good customer service with live chat(Kraken also has this) and are spoken about pretty well. I only heard about them since the moon listing and their exchange service has just been so freaking smooth and seamless. I haven't used the heavily but from the many reviews I read and my own experience I'd have to rank them top 4 probably at least. Worst I can say is that they may have *some* liquidity issues imo but that would be a preliminary judgement  as i don't have the most experience with them and it's also highly dependent on the token. Also, their tutorial articles seem to be very basic. But all very minor things in the grand scheme.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yamxhk\/reviewing_crypto_exchangesare_there_any_good\/","author":"OneThatNoseOne","num_comments":32,"created_utc":1666442957000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"Reviewing Crypto Exchanges...Are There Any Good Exchanges Left??","distinguished":null,"id":"yamxhk","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":7,"selftext":"A key aspect of a bear market is that the market crabs for a long time and that every pump gets faded. This price action has a clear psychological effect: It trains people to mistrust any rally and to believe that the prices will not go up and likely go lower. Hence, they dont buy or even sell low.\n\nIf you ask me, most people in this space *are* trained to mistrust any rally. Positive posts here are often met with heavy skepticism and with reasons as to why a rally will fail (*\"But look at the macro environment!\"; \"Inflation just entered the room\"; \"We will just see these same prices again in 2 days!*\"). Retail interest is low. And people are shorting the lows, as evidenced by there being over 1 billion of liquidations yesterday. To be fair, so far these views have been correct as crypto has been dumping and crabbing for almost a year now.\n\nHowever, **I think that this recent pump could very well be the start of the real rally**. And by real rally I mean the rally that is *perceived* as another sucker's rally yet actually drags us out of bear territory. I predict that we are (soon) starting the disbelief stage of the Wall Street Cheat Sheet below. I will present a few key arguments for that.\n\n[Wall Street Cheat Sheet](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mjpq6ofq87w91.png?width=577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43c3973edb76c33fd6784951cba1d3ae18d4cd5f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1) Just about every crypto bottom indicator has flashed**\n\nWhether it is the Pi Cycle indicator, the Hash Ribbons indicator, or the Puell Multiple indicator; they all flashed and based on historical data, the bear market bottom should be in. These indicators have done a great job predicting major bottoms in the past and have not failed us yet. Do they provide a guarantee (during this crazy economic environment)? Of course not. But they do provide relevant data. This is not the main point I want to make but it is good to keep in mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Hash Ribbons indicator predicts the bottom is in](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ao5l3udgj7w91.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4586065b350a3960ed76139e85e432481d4025cc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2) The Dollar (DXY) is losing its parabolic trend and a key indicator just flashed 'sell'** \n\nThe strenght of the dollar relative to other key currencies is absolutely key given the strong inverse correlation between the DXY and crypto. It is necessary for the DXY to dump to give crypto breathing room becuase only then will risk-on assets flourish. The DXY is losing its upwards trend and a key indicator that correctly identified the 1985 and 2002 top flashed again. Note that it flashed a *little* early in 1985. \n\n[DXY losing its parabolic trend](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xhaqah1xe7w91.jpg?width=2594&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d61423b465c4968dc6d912fa06ec4ed6f02b516d)\n\n[Another perspective of the DXY losing its parabolic trend](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/neonctgsh7w91.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b14e0b52b64cb9225bbd8812cccca0a0ba08e347)\n\n[A key indicator that has been very accurate in the past produced a sell signal](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/daada39h97w91.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=130b8869b91da0e6a66e92c69124687cf6ad08f4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3) The (institutional) adoption during the 2022 bear is out of this world** \n\nDuring past bear markets, many people feared that crypto would go to zero. The situation now is very different, as we *know* that crypto will be huge. It is more a question of how much pain we have to endure before that happens and which projects become big. Why? Well, every day there is bullish news of adoption. Here is a list with examples of instutitonal adoption over the past \\~6 weeks: \n\n* Google partnered with Coinbase to accept crypto payments for cloud services\n* McDonald\u2019s started to accept Bitcoin and Tether in Swiss town\n* Meta will introduce NFT crossposting and sharing on Instagram\n* Chainlink partnered with Swift\n* Ledger wallets are available at Best Buy\n* FTX and Visa partnered to enable paying with crypto via debit cards in 40 countries\n* Moscow Stock Exchange will become crypto and bitcoin exchange\n* Citadel, Charles Schwab, and Fidelity confirmed cryptocurrency exchange launch\n* World's largest banks are exposed to $9 billion in crypto assets\n* Facebook And Instagram Will Allow Users To Connect Crypto Wallets\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are more reasons as to why I believe we are entering the \"sucker's rally\". For instance, inflation is topping (e.g. Oil down more than 30%, energy prices down, lots of energy reserves in Europe for the winter, US CPI will decrease, US rate hikes will decrease). Another example is how the chart looks. But I will keep this short. \n\nI am curious what you think. Importantly, I dont expect us to just fly out of here to all time high. Moreover, I know that there are no guarantees for the future, but if you ask me, the future is looking bright and we are close to crawling ourselves out of this hole, unless something very unexpected happens.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ye7wdo\/this_weeks_pump_could_very_well_be_the_start_of\/","author":"Beyonderr","num_comments":145,"created_utc":1666815716000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"PERSPECTIVE","title":"This week's pump could very well be the start of the real reversal that brings crypto out of bear territory","distinguished":null,"id":"ye7wdo","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":6,"selftext":"Thought this was a fairly helpful summary of the crypto market in the last few months.\n\nExcerpted from https:\/\/ripple.com\/insights\/q3-2022-xrp-markets-report\/\n\n.\n\nIn Q3, the macroeconomic environment continued to experience considerable volatility in response to geopolitical and economic events ranging from further escalation in the Russia-Ukraine War to declining economic health in the Eurozone and the UK. In addition, a persistently strong U.S. labor market and stubborn headline inflation prompted what some perceive as a hardline stance towards bringing down inflation by the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nThe U.S. dollar remained strong against all other paired assets, with the U.S. Dollar Index climbing above 114, a level not seen since 2002. This has been the primary contributor to tepid price action across crypto and FX markets (such as EUR, GBP, JPY and other emerging market currencies).  \n\nThat said, crypto markets showed signs of resilience by outperforming asset classes such as equities, bonds and FX. Over Q3, bitcoin (BTC) outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by over 5%, and outperformed U.S. treasuries by over 8%. During September, which was a substantially red month for equities and bonds, crypto found strong support across tokens and projects, and managed to trade mostly range-bound. This led to a near term decoupling of correlations with BTC to S&amp;P at 0.5 and with XRP to S&amp;P at 0.21. At the beginning of Q3, these numbers were materially higher. \n\nLeverage in the system remained constant. While trading volumes and open interest lingered at median values for BTC over the last two years, there was a meaningful return to pre-crash levels in ether (ETH). Furthermore, concerted efforts to bring critical traditional markets leveraged infrastructure to crypto were visible. These ranged from prime brokers, clearing houses, OTC derivatives desks and uncollateralized lenders.  \n\nNotably, Ethereum\u2019s widely anticipated upgrade to Proof-of-Stake, referred to as the Merge, crossed the finish line after years of experimentation and testing. The Merge played a large role in anticipatory positioning and price action by participants but ultimately had little impact on the markets. That said, the effects of the dramatic shift in the tokenomics of ETH are still being realized by the market and will take time to materialize.\n\nWhile equities continued to sell off, and crypto companies maintained hiring freezes and conducted layoffs, announcements of strong funding deals with respectable valuations were seen. FTX announced it had at least $1B to spend on acquisitions and bailouts and weeks later, the company won a bid to buy Voyager\u2019s assets. In addition, FTX was also rumored to be buying Celsius and to be in talks with investors to raise another round at a valuation of $32B. Lastly, Animoca closed a $110M round led by Temasek and Pantera announced its plans to raise a second blockchain fund. While new money entering the industry remains at a 12 month low ($3.3B this year vs $7B last year according to Crunchbase), this still indicates that conviction, sources of capital and outlook for the future continue to be seen as positive.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yfazjg\/crypto_market_summary_in_q3_2022\/","author":"chintokkong","num_comments":14,"created_utc":1666923474000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"GENERAL-NEWS","title":"Crypto market summary in Q3 2022","distinguished":null,"id":"yfazjg","downs":null,"ups":null}

The same arguments could have been done against Bitcoin and Ethereum when their prices collapsed + 95 %. Also, there are things pointing at the price being artificially pumped up through futures contract on FTX before launch. Anyways, I personally don't think price action is an argument against the tech, I don't see how it could be but it seems to be very important for some of you.  \n\n\nI found Bitcoin in December 2012 and I saw the interesting tech behind it.  \nI found Ethereum in 2015 and had the same profound feeling.  \nI found and experienced using ICP in January 2022 and had the same feeling.  \n\n\nFrom my POV it's a regime shift, an evolution of previous blockchains.   \nThe innovation of [canister smart contracts](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LKpGuBOXxtQ?t=75) is very profound imo.  \nYes, it also comes with potential limitations on aspects of decentralization when requiring much higher specs to run a node.

Both are competitors \/ rivals. Keeping this in mind is important when it comes to bias around the entire topic.\n\na simplified TL;DR of the **CURRENT** situation:\n\n1. FTX mints FTT and lends it to Alameda Research\n2. Alameda borrows USD stables against FTX\n3. Alameda send the USD back to FTX\n\nThe result is something called a \"flywheel scheme\"\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kcx0r4uwney91.png?width=709&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59448b37b838d37116627e21ac7c4a8287e9dbe9\n\nThe problem: FTX &amp; Alameda Research seem to hold \\~ 8 Billion in FTT tokens like that. The catch? The market cap is only 3 billion. 5 Billion could potentially be false reported money on their balance sheet.\n\n**TL;DR** : It's a heated topic and all rumors but safe to say that something shady is going on in the background of FTX. Getting your crypto off exchanges that you don't need anytime soon is always the safest way to secure your funds. We are in a nearly year long bear market and it's safe to say that it'll continue through **at least** early 2023. Better safe then sorry!\n\n**Since this is an ongoing drama right now :**\n\nIf anyone in this sub knows more about the current situation feel free to add anything but keep it serious and informative.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":481,"selftext":"We should all know that billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried owns two main businesses that make up his empire: FTX (his exchange) and Alameda Research (his trading firm). A few days ago, Alameda's balance sheet information came into the public eye. And it either has some interesting curious points of note or some serious new flags, depending on who you ask.\n\nAlameda owns assets that amount to $14.6 billion. Now, the single largest asset is $3.66 billion of \u201cunlocked FTT.\u201d and the third-largest, $2.16 billion pile of \u201cFTT collateral\". This means that just about 40% of the value of Alameda is made up of FTT tokens. The problem is that FTT token(FTX exchange token) is controlled and managed *centrally* by FTX, such that they may print it out of thin air at their whim and fancy. And since SBF owns both companies he can easily sell or loan at extremely favourable rates, if not outright gift tokens likely indirectly though another company or a loan that is never paid back, from FTX to Alameda (or basically give tokens from himself to himself) and balloon Alameda's asset value for basically nothing.\n\nYou may think that FTX excessively printing tokens is a suicide pact as it would drive the token price down and supply increases, but you would be wrong. Think about how burning works. Token burns generally increase token value by reducing the supply that is *available* *on the market,* as burnt tokens still 'exist', but are simply inaccessible. In the same way SBF and FTX can print however many tokens they so desire and it wouldn't affect price as long as those tokens don't hit the market, *and they don't need to.*\n\nSee SBF and Alameda can simply receive FTT tokens from FTX basically for free, and then **take a loan against these tokens**. In this way, the multitude of FTT tokens they print for nothing never hits the market and never negatively affect the price, however each of those tokens still *hold their market value* allowing SBF and Alameda to *borrow against* those FTT tokens and get...basically free money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Infinite Money Diagram](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/42qrx4zxljy91.png?width=1177&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2010738c443496b23d8816629934782a7e694492)\n\nWhat lends strong credence to this is that on June 30th, Alameda's FTT token asset value was $**6.1 Billion in FTT tokens** but the **circulating supply is** ***only*** **$3.6 Billion.** Looks like somebody is printing tokens but not putting it on the market.\n\nNow going back to their balance sheet, Alameda has 2.16 billion in 'FTT collateral'. This implies Alameda has gained $2.16 billion in loans where they used FTT tokens as collateral. They too have a further 3.66B in free FTT tokens to obtain another multi-billion dollar loan if they so choose. They also have 292 million in 'locked FTT'. Interestingly, the 'locked FTT' tokens are conservatively treated at 50% of their fair value, meaning that Alameda has cut their FTT liabilities(what they owe) in half with this *simple accounting trick.*\n\nOf course, owners of FTT tokens gain massive discounts when trading on FTX. Just another gift from SBF's right hand to his left. Now we know how volatile prices and token holdings can be. Roughly estimating the token amounts held by Alameda on the timeframe the balance sheet info is dated reveals that Alameda **alone** *and not FTX* holds about **75% of** ***total*** **supply.** I say *total* supply and not circulating supply. This is **based on FTX's own FTT token data.** As to why Alameda holds the majority and not FTX,  it is probably a lot easier for *Alameda* to gain loans against these tokens(using them as collateral) than *FTX* since many lenders would be unwilling to lend to FTX *knowing* they have complete control over the token. This could be bypassed using Defi loans but is almost certainly an issue for Cefi loans that SBF may want. But for Alameda to solidly own somewhere between 70-80% of FTT tokens raises some HUGE red flags. If this doesn't validate many of the concerns I outlined above, I don't know what will.\n\nEDIT: All of this also very much explains that in SBF's and FTX's $1.4 Billion purchase of Voyager, [only $51 million](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/09\/30\/ftx-is-paying-51-million-in-cash-for-voyager-assets-court-records-.html) of that amount is actually cash.\n\nResearch Sources:\n\n[https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2022\/11\/02\/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet\/](https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2022\/11\/02\/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet\/)","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yoof8g\/sbf_and_alameda_research_allegedly_using_ftx_in\/","author":"OneThatNoseOne","num_comments":295,"created_utc":1667831004000,"edited":1667912237000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANALYSIS","title":"SBF And Alameda Research Allegedly Using FTX In 'Infinite Money' Scheme","distinguished":null,"id":"yoof8g","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":0,"selftext":"As most here are familiar with the adage \"Not your keys, not your crypto.\", you'll find this to be proven true time and time again. \n\nNow, with the recently squabbles between FTX and Binance, it's important to keep a few things in mind. \n\n\\#1 They are both *Centralized Exchanges*. Plain and simple. It doesn't matter who supports what or implements more DeFi features than the other. They are both ingrained in traditional financial practices and neither are to be trusted. That's kind of the whole purpose of crypto; trustless and verifiable finance...\n\n\\#2 All CEXs keep their own ledgers with very likely many IOUs. So again, \"Not your keys, not your crypto.\" It may be convenient to keep funds on a CEX for quick and cheap exchanging, but you're always going to run the risk that you won't be able to withdraw or trade at any given time due to some \"technical error\" or other reasons. Remove that trust and take control of your funds yourself! \n\n\\#3 Get a hardware wallet. Ledger is the most common and popular one, but others are out there. Keep that wallet safe and practice good habits. \n\nNow, I just want to point out a few other amusements. \n\nReddit uses FTX for it's liquidity. \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3wlsutj7kjy91.png?width=403&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c6d415c165ce0149f2ab35fbb4a9a092f9c7273\n\nIf you look to the side and click on \"Get Gas Funds for Network Fees\", you'll notice a popup wanting to redirect you to FTX.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zjt78otdkjy91.png?width=657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11ad8fcec25b770788088883735ac8bb773e7d83\n\nI don't know if FTX is insolvent currently or not, but I would always recommend having a few accounts spread around for these types of occasions. Personally, I like Kraken for a CEX. But that's just me. Either way, if you use any CEX, just be safe and remove your funds when not immediately needed. \n\nCheers everyone, and have a great week!","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yop6q1\/reddit_ftx_and_protecting_yourself\/","author":"FordicusMaximus","num_comments":32,"created_utc":1667832607000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"Reddit, FTX, and protecting yourself.","distinguished":null,"id":"yop6q1","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":75,"selftext":"\u201cInstead of decentralization of finance, we choose a centralized unregulated bank like system.\u201d\n\n\\- u\/GaryJulesMCOC\\[1\\]\n\nBeen trying to make sense of all that\u2019s come out recently. It is pretty complicated and filled with contradicting statements and numbers thrown around. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, like everyone, I would like nothing more than for this to pass over smoothly. **However**, we can fear (not afraid to use the word when I should) another slamming effect on the whole crypto industry like in June, and most importantly, on us plebs, who as you know, always get the shortest end of the stick. Hope for the best, but\u2026\n\n**Here\u2019s where we are today:**\n\nThere are reports of **MAJOR**\\[2\\] issues with withdrawals from FTX. They\u2019ve been loading up their withdrawal wallets with 50 million, which were gone in seconds. Here\u2019s the links: USDC\\[3\\] USDT\\[4\\]. FTX seems to have run out of stables, yet BlockFi depends on it, having passed its assets to SBF.\n\nBinance are liquidating **any**\\[5\\] remaining FTT on their books. This comes after a report FTX's liquidity appeared to be\\[6\\], well, worryingly solidifying.\n\nNow to understand how this ties and applies to BlockFi, let\u2019s take a step back to where it all began\u2026..\n\n**The 2022 Liquidity Crisis and why BlockFi is dependent on FTX.**\n\nWhat happened then :\n\n* Starting May 2022, the crypto market faced a massive liquidity crisis when multi billion dollar companies lost up to 99% of their value in a few weeks: These include Terra LUNA, Celsius, 3AC, Voyager.\n* In mid-June, BlockFi liquidated 3AC\\[7\\]. The company was a strategic investor\\[8\\] in BlockFi between 2020-21m according to an article on BlockFi\u2019s website. BlockFi lent bitcoin to Three Arrows Capital\\[9\\]. When GBTC was trading at a premium to its Net Asset Value (NAV), 3AC earned profits arbitraging this premium by depositing bitcoin directly with Grayscale and waiting a few months to vest trust units of GBTC. Here\u2019s a Tweet\\[10\\] visualizing what I\u2019m saying.\n* BlockFi didn\u2019t directly address the situation. Instead Zac Prince posted a Twitter\\[11\\] thread on their risk management practices, assuring customers that no funds were impacted. The company\u2019s relationship with 3AC and Grayscale was not discussed.\n* In 2022, according to projections, BlockFi is expected to lose a further \\~$104m, equal to losing \\~$285,000 a day. \\[12\\]\n* Also, the Private Shares Fund has slashed valuations\\[13\\] of BlockFi series E warrants to \u201cworthless\u201d compared to a valuation of $67 per unit in April. As revealed in their report at the end of June, the private fund also downgraded BlockFi\u2019s preferred shares valuation to $20 per share, down from $77 just three months ago.\n* As a result of the liquidity crisis, BlockFi announced a term sheet with FTX US\\[14\\]. A $400M revolving credit facility which is subordinate to all client funds, and an option to acquire BlockFi at a variable price of up to $240M based on performance triggers.\n* In August, the deal was formalized\\[15\\]. What was not made public however, was what BlockFi must do to earn that amount, and how far it is from those goals. And nobody accurately revealed how little Bankman-Fried\u2019s company could end up paying.\n\nBasically, a **bail out from FTX** was in place. So far so good (let\u2019s say). \u201cFunds safu\u201d. However, following that a few more strange things started happening. Namely:\n\n* Exiting\\[16\\] BlockFi are David Olsson, global head of institutional distribution; Samia Bayou, global head of private client investors; and Shane O\u2019Callaghan, senior director of institutional sales for Europe, Middle East and Africa, sources told CoinDesk.\n* According to data\\[17\\] from Addictive Tips, BlockFi fired 20% of its workforce.\n* Just recently, it became public knowledge that BlockFi\\[18\\] is reportedly facing potential losses of up to $80 millions due to exposure to crypto miner Core Scientific. Since their stock was down as much as 77%, a bankruptcy is very likely. In this scenario holders of Core\u2019s common stock could suffer \u201ca total loss of their investment\u201d. Now, BlockFi\u2019s term sheets are not publicly available, but a Reddit\\[19\\] post alleged that BlockFi offers loans of larger than \u20ac10 million with a 10% bitcoin deposit along with collateral against equipment. You do the math.\n\nLet\u2019s for the sake of the argument, say things are still okay(ish). As long as daddy SBF has the funds to back all of this up, it shouldn't be an issue, right? Right. Now let\u2019s take a step back and take a closer look at daddy\u2019s business recently.\n\nAmid big talk from Sam that he was in considering joining Elon Musk on the twitter\\[20\\] deal, and after FTX also got involved in bailing out Voyager\\[21\\], which I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of, this comes out:\n\n* The Texas\\[22\\] State Securities Board is investigating crypto exchange FTX US, its parent company FTX and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, over potential securities violations.\n\nWhat transpired is that Alameda\\[23\\] Research, Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s trading firm\u2019s Assets are Reportedly \u201cEntirely Illiquid\u201d. Among the assets are:\n\n* $3.66B FTT\n* $2.16B \u201cFTT collateral\u201d\n* $3.37B crypto ($292M SOL, $863M \u201clocked SOL\u201d)\n* $134M USD\n* $2B equity securities\n\nThere are more FTX tokens among its $8 billion of liabilities: $292 million of \u201clocked FTT.\u201d (The liabilities are dominated by $7.4 billion of loans.)\n\nFor comparison, there are about 197 million FTT tokens worth $5.1 billion in circulation, according to FTX\u2019s website. To put things in perspective, Alameda Research\u2019s assets contain $5.82B worth of FTT. FTT\u2019s market cap as of Nov. 3 is $3.2B.\n\nI\u2019m guessing you know where I\u2019m headed with this.\n\n\u201cInsert Michael Jackson eating popcorn GIF\u201d\n\nTLDR:\n\nFTX has **MUCH** bigger issues than helping out BlockFi right now. Probably won\u2019t be able to afford to be BlockFi\u2019s sugar daddy for much longer.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":24,"selftext":"Many of you are likely aware that the SEC won its case against LBRY today. For those that don't know about LBRY, LBRY, is\/was a blockchain-based file-sharing and payment network that powers decentralized platforms, primarily social networks and video platforms. LBRY's creators also created Odysee, an open-source video-sharing website that uses the network, and that was split into a separate company on October 1, 2021. Odysee was basically a decentralized youtube that allowed people to tip content creators.\n\nThe SEC sued LBRY last March and won its case today. The following information is from the SEC's press release on the case: \"\\[t\\]he SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The SEC's complaint alleged that, from at least July 2016 to February 2021, LBRY, which provides a video sharing application, sold crypto asset securities called \"LBRY Credits\" to numerous investors, including investors based in the US. The complaint alleges that this was an offering and sale of securities under the federal securities laws, and that LBRY did not file a registration statement for the offering. The complaint further alleges that by failing to file a registration statement, LBRY denied prospective investors the information required for such an offering to the public.\"\n\nThis case is relevant because it puts most of the cryptocurrency market\/ industry in the SEC's crosshairs. It is also relevant because the SEC will most likely use the LBRY ruling in its case against Ripple Labs, and probably the Coinbase employees that were charged with insider trading too. While it should be noted that LBRY relied on the fair notice defense, and Ripple Labs is arguing that XRP fails the Howey test, this really wasn't great news to hear.\n\nOne of the SEC's main arguments was that LBRY pre-mined its tokens, and kept a portion of those tokens for itself, and also that the LBC token did not have a use case when it was first created. How do you think centralized exchange tokens like BNB , CRO, FTT, Gemini dollar and others will be affected by this ruling? What about Tether?\n\nI think that each coin\/its founders will have to argue that their token fails the Howey test, or that fair notice was not given. I don't think that the LBRY ruling will act as a blanket ban on the cryptos we know and love. I do think that the cryptocurrency industry will continue to feel uneasy while current and additional SEC cases are litigated. I think it is annoying that the SEC can say \"you didn't give prosepctive investors information required for such an offering\" when no one knows shit about fuck. Being more serious, it's annoying that while the SEC is arguing securities laws were broken, it is ultimately the hodlers of the tokens that are harmed by the decrease in price that inevitably results from a crypto being deemed a security.\n\nIt's my opinion that bitcoin is probably the most safe (as everyone has been saying) from the SEC. For the short-mid term, that's what I will be focusing my DCA on.\n\nSo, what are everyone's thoughts on today's ruling? How do you feel? Are you buying more, keeping your DCA, or holding off until more news? Wen Lambo?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: SEC won its case against LBRY today. How are you feeling about it?\n\nEdit: updated information about the Coinbase employees the SEC charged with insider trading.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":3,"selftext":"Binance vs FTX started recently in the marketplace, while SEC vs LBRY ended not long ago in the court with LBRY losing the case.\n\nSad to say, the ruling in SEC vs LBRY case still doesn't provide regulatory clarity as to the definitive conditions (the essential ingredients) that establish an offered asset as a security. The 76 year-old Howey Test doesn't seem quite helpful with regards to crypto.\n\n.\n\nFor those interested in the Judge's ruling of SEC vs LBRY, you can read it here: https:\/\/odysee.com\/@lbry:3f\/secvslbrysummaryjudgementruling:a\n\n.\n\nSince the SEC vs Ripple case is still ongoing, thought I share some of the ambiguity of Howey Test with regards to the crypto token XRP.\n\n- I think it's quite obvious that when XRP was first created, it's not a security. There were ~~no XRP sales made yet~~ marketing of XRP yet upon creation. \n\n- And so there are no investors with \"*an investment of money in common enterprise*\" (first and second prong of Howey Test), and no \"*expectation of profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party*\" (third prong of Howey Test).\n\n- When then is the moment that XRP turns into a 'security' according to the SEC?\n\n- The moment when Ripple started its promotion of XRP and XRP ledger to potential investors?\n\n- Does this promotion then suddenly convert all XRP en masse into securities, including those that Ripple does not own? Or is it the specific arrangement (the investment contract) sold by Ripple to the Purchaser that is the security? \n\n- What exactly is the security?\n\n- It is like if I've managed to somehow own 80% of the diamonds in the world. When I start making efforts to promote diamonds to potential buyers, do all diamonds suddenly become securities? Including those not owned by me (such that should these other owners sell their diamonds, they are selling securities)?\n\n- How exactly does my representation of diamonds (as profitable through my marketing effort) cause all diamonds to become securities?

At the beginning of 2022, SBF and Alameda Research(trading firm owned by SBF) received [37% of all USDT tokens](https:\/\/protos.com\/tether-papers-crypto-stablecoin-usdt-investigation-analysis\/) issued at the beginning of 2022. This is by far the largest amount of Tether received by **any** firm. The now-bankrupt Three Arrows Capital received at a minimum 7.3% of all USDT issued. Aside from stablecoins, Three Arrows\u2019 main address mostly traded in WBTC, YFI, UNI, SUSHI and **FTX's FTT.** Bitquery shows that Three Arrows has collectively been sent billions in USDT from exchanges Binance, Bitfinex, and **FTX.** The last sentence isn't out of place by itself as these are three of the largest exchanges, but in the context of everything it serves to validate a theory. This is the same Three Arrows whose shady founders bought a 50 million yacht just before bankruptcy and [went missing](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/07\/12\/founders-of-bankrupt-crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-go-missing.html) after the company faced liquidity issues. Again, likely coincidences but we continue.\n\nNow, Tether has been [mired in scandals](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/06\/17\/technology\/tether-stablecoin-cryptocurrency.html) for quite a while. This ranges from lying about being fully backed for which they were fined, a plummeting of the market cap earleir this year due to a user exodus from mistrust, . allegations of [market manipulation](https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/bitcoin-price-rises-after-usdt-misprint-do-bots-trade-on-tether-mints\/), failing to be fully audited after 8 years of existence and its close business dealings with Celsius.\n\nBut what has also been strange is FTX has a [market share](https:\/\/ftx.com\/volume-monitor) of about 11%, while Binance has a market share over 50%. However, a few weeks ago markets [saw 700M in liquidations](https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/markets\/2022\/10\/26\/crypto-markets-see-largest-short-liquidations-in-15-months-ether-leads-token-surge\/) where 500M of these liquidations were on FTX alone. This again occurred a week ago in a major [DOGE-led market pump](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yhcbjh\/dogeled_market_pump_led_to_500m_in_liquidations\/) where there were 500M in liquidations and 365M occurred on FTX alone. It is very strange as we see this trend over and over if we go through data on [Coinglass](https:\/\/www.coinglass.com\/LiquidationData) where in almost every single major market liquidation event , FTX has the largest amount of liquidations, usually having a number fully several times the total amount of Binance has even though Binance actually has several times the volume of FTX. Liquidation events at the end of October show FTX to having liquidated up to 10-20x the amount of funds Binance did, even though FTX is supposed to have 5x **less** market share.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/b9co4t6pnqy91.png?width=240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bcad2de005ae3b5c93ea4b2ebedffa9e80c114f\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lkxdb47pnqy91.png?width=237&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a35bb882f24272ecd4b3706e4c05452e9e7bb524\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bxney47pnqy91.png?width=234&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1361fbb650795ee2ebd9a6035b7fac4dac46231\n\nThere are times when the liquidation data of FTX is *\"only\"* 1.5x-2x that of Binance like in mid-August and early September but it should only be 5x less as i said before.\n\nThe allegation then is this: **wash trading fraud**. Alameda is using their massive Tether reserves to wash trade on FTX and in so doing manipulate FTX's volume upward. With a huge amount of USDT stablecoins this would become much easier to do as you have a base currency(USDT) to easily liquidate millions of tokens into and out of. The irony about this is on [FTX's own volume monitor page](https:\/\/ftx.com\/volume-monitor) they warn:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Self-snitch?](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cy9octnckqy91.png?width=403&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bed7234eccb366d284d86f39c91d1af5280bcdeb)\n\nI *think* this is a coincidence that Alameda owns 37% of all USDT tokens and also report that 37% of volume is fake. But it's one heck of a coincidence.\n\nIf true, this then means that FTX is artificially increasing it's revenue thus increase its balance sheet and company value. Then, if SBF so desires, he may borrow against the inflated company assets to get more money which can then be further used to again inflate assets. It also seeks to further entice more traders into the market and increase profits from fees. As of now, these are just allegation but it is ***extremely*** **strange** FTX has *such* high volume. Something is going on and it doesn't look good. Not one bit.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ypntal\/sbfs_alameda_deep_dealings_with_tether_and\/","author":"OneThatNoseOne","num_comments":24,"created_utc":1667917639000,"edited":1667918771000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANALYSIS","title":"SBF's Alameda Deep Dealings With Tether And Alleged FTX Market Fraud","distinguished":null,"id":"ypntal","downs":null,"ups":null}

He has been working on federal legislation namely something called a \"bit license\" which would seek to require KYC (know your customer i.e. require a driver's license or passport) for all crypto transactions... even those on decentralized exchanges which don't currently require KYC.\n\nKYC flies in the face of the crypto thesis which is decentralized autonomous transactions.\nFTX has been buying up tons of at risk crypto exchanges and has become an absolutely juggernaut in the cryptospace. If FTX and BF were to be successfull pushing crypto legislation they would have a strangle hold on the industry. Also edit to add FTX has deep ties to Blackrock.\n\nBinance didn't like this and moved to liquidate all their holdings of the FTX token causing downward pressure on the price of FTX. FTX had an investment arm called \u201cAlameda research\" who has supposedly leveraged the FTX token for possible sketchy investments. If the price of FTX dips far below its current value of $22.00 we may see serious margin calls and they may be liquidated similar to the LUNA fiasco we saw earlier this summer.\n\nLong story short, the 2 largest behemoths in the crypto space are trading punches and all crypto users will suffer.\n\nOne other peice of the puzzle is the SEC won a serious victory over a crypto company called library today and declares that were offering crypto tokens for sale as unregistered securities. This could put ALL crypto currencies in the US in jeopardy of bring deemed unregistered securities which would be potentially disastrous. There is speculation that SBF was working on capitalizing on this new classification by being one of the few exchanges registered with the SEC to offer token sales as securities.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ypppme\/i_dont_subscribe_to_superstonk_but_i_saw_this\/","author":"8512764EA","num_comments":24,"created_utc":1667921711000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"GENERAL-NEWS","title":"I don\u2019t subscribe to superstonk but I saw this post in popular.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":0,"selftext":"The following is a partial review published by Smith and Crown several years ago.  I do not pretend to understand the mechanics of how an exchange works but would this not imply a \"we can't fail\" mentality?\n\n\nFROM SMITH AND CROWN:\n\nFTX\u2019s flagship products are its\u00a0non-inverted\u00a0(i.e. BTC\/USD rather than USD\/BTC), quarterly and perpetual cryptoasset futures, and the defining features thereof are a three-tiered\u00a0clawback\u00a0prevention mechanism, a centralized collateral pool, and universal stablecoin settlement. Socialized losses and clawbacks occur when markets move decidedly counter to large leveraged future positions such that the account holding them has a substantially negative net asset value; because the censorship resistance of blockchains make it impossible to repossess assets held outside of a given exhange by the operator of a bankrupt account, the\u00a0exchange must subsidize\u00a0its losses by repossessing profits from other accounts\u2019 reciprocal future positions. While many exchanges maintain an\u00a0insurance fund\u00a0to reduce the need for such socialized clawbacks, outsized losses from exchanges\u2019 typically low maintenance margins and poor liquidity often overwhelm these funds\u2019 abilities to adequately compensate unilaterally. Further, coverage from insurance funds fail to resolve the position and, thus, prevent future losses should market trends continue.\n\nIn contrast, FTX\u2019s liquidation engine intends to reduce the likelihood of clawbacks becoming necessary through three distinct steps. First, in the event a future position falls below its\u00a0maintenance margin, FTX begins sending volume-limited liquidation orders regardless of the asset\u2019s current market price to close down the position. Should this action fail to adequately resolve the position prior to bankruptcy, FTX\u2019s \u2018backstop liquidity provider\u2019 system calls for consenting accounts to internalize the position and assume responsibility for its collateralization; the operators thereof then hedge their books via other exchanges, effectively transferring external liquidity to FTX\u2019s ecosystem and removing the position\u2019s toxicity from FTX\u2019s books. Finally, if all else fails, FTX intends to compensate for excess losses through an insurance fund and, when necessary, minor socialized clawbacks.\n\nAdditional problems also arise in cryptoasset derivative exchanges from inefficient collateralization procedures. Often, collateral must be posted in separate\u00a0margin accounts\u00a0for separate positions and the collateralizing asset must match that underlying derivative contract. The result is an unnecessarily byzantine web of accounts and the counterintuitive requirement that one must directly hold the asset one intends to short. To address these hindrances, FTX adopts the collateralization protocol of traditional futures markets in which collateral for multiple positions may be denominated in a single currency and held in one central margin wallet. While addressing the aforementioned issues, this protocol also eases the rearrangement of collateral amongst an account\u2019s varying positions to account for market movements, favorable or unfavorable.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ypqmfg\/would_the_clawback_prevention_mechanism_be\/","author":"TurtlesBeSlow","num_comments":6,"created_utc":1667923647000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"Would the \"clawback prevention mechanism\" be applicable?","distinguished":null,"id":"ypqmfg","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":24,"selftext":"Given the current market conditions and the collapsing environment of FTT it's important to remember the risk involved in shorting. During the UST collapse, Terra Luna collapsed to .00000006 and large trading firms still got liquidated shorting it.\n\nShorting is borrowing crypto then selling it and agreeing to pay it back at a later time. The idea is you borrow when it's more expensive and pay it back when it's cheaper and keep the difference between your more expensive sell cost and the cheaper buy cost.\n\n# The idea of shorting FTT or another crypto might be extremely appealing right now, but there is a ton of risk.\n\n1. The longer you wait to short a falling asset the more likely you short at the bottom and the price goes up after and you get liquidated.\n2. When you short there is unlimited risk for any money being used as collateral. If the price goes up you can lose all your money and have no crypto.\n\n# If you decide to be a degen there are things you should know to minimize your risk.\n\n* Make sure you have sufficient collateral for a rise, so you don't get instantly liquidated.\n* The higher the lever the faster you'll get liquidated with any movement up.\n* Only ever short with small amounts of gambling money. **Risk $50 in your leverage bet - not all of your crypto.**\n\nI can't stress this enough - multi-million dollar firms got liquidated shorting Terra Luna on the collapse to zero.\n\nIf you're unsure how that could happen, let's say you're shorting UTT and the price jumps from $14 to $18 and then drops to $7. Depending on your lever and the amount of collateral you held. You might have been forced to liquidate your position and pay back the borrowed crypto. Even though the price dropped 50% from your entry point later - the 35% increase might have been enough to take all of your funds.\n\n# Playing with futures is extremely dangerous and you should expect to lose all the money you put into it.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ypr5fo\/before_you_decide_to_play_with_leverage_on_a\/","author":"GabeSter","num_comments":59,"created_utc":1667924762000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"Before you decide to play with leverage on a collapsing crypto project - know that large firms got liquidated shorting UST to zero","distinguished":null,"id":"ypr5fo","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":157,"selftext":"So now we know that SBF was actually swimming naked the entire time. What we thought was Chad behavior earlier in the year buying up distressed assets\/exchanges was likely his attempt to shield himself from liquidations that he was also probably very close to triggering.\n\nA bailout for FTX is good news *in the short term* for the reason that funds are safu and another ill-fated Chapter 11 has been avoided, but its worth considering the broader implications here. \n\nWhy didnt Alameda bail out FTX? Well thats because Alameda has huge debt obligations of their own. They have ~14BN in assets to ~7BN in liabilities, but lots of those assets are illiquid. $3.66b FTT, $2.16b \u201cFTT collateral\u201d, $3.37b crypto ($292m SOL, $863m \u201clocked SOL\u201d), $134m USD &amp; $2b \u201cequity securities. Theyre incredibly low on cash flow.\n\nFTX will live on, but Alameda doesnt look great considering their biggest bag is FTT and CZ more likely than not has very little interest in salvaging an illiquid shitcoin when he has his own exchange\/exchange token and will probably let it die. His interest is now in FTX and has no duty to Alameda.\n\nAlameda has been borrowing against this FTT and using it as collateral in several different loan agreements as well as defi positions (Blockfi, Genesis, AAVE, ABRA). This will leave Alameda and its lenders taking a huge hit and scrounging for liquidity, and of course their next biggest bag is $SOL. Alameda needs to unwind some big positions and probably will not be able to avoid liquidation without dumping a sizeable portion of their SOL bag, and what will happen to Solana when their biggest proponent is forced to sell? \n\nTheres likely going to be big ripple effects from this, and unfortunately ALOT of this is going to be up to CZ and what he wants to salvage","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ypvmjc\/serious_regardless_of_a_bailout_the_worst_has\/","author":"marsangelo","num_comments":279,"created_utc":1667934892000,"edited":1667964677000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"[SERIOUS] Regardless of a bailout, the worst has likely yet to come","distinguished":null,"id":"ypvmjc","downs":null,"ups":null}

Crypto is going to be hammered down to the bottom, bottom, bottom.\n\nBuy the Crypto that didn't have an easy way rising, and yet survived.

For the love of god, just buy Bitcoin and keep it quiet about anything else, or this whole space might die out as a whole.

Nothing else can have so many twists and turns as the crypto industry. It was a struggle for me at least to even be up-to-date with all of the new news that came in literally every hour.\n\nSo here just some of the main aspects and events:\n\nPre-drama: Rumors float in that Binance is selling their FTT and that FTX is in a bad shape, causing some panic which is mostly debunked as no one thought FTX woukd actually just fail. \n\n1. Binance CZ says on Twitter that binance is selling all of their FTT due to some trust-issues with FTX.\n\n2. FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried infamously says that \"everything is fine\".\n\n3. Panic erupts as people get ready withdraw all of their Crypto from FTX as it many be very risky, FTT is already down over - 15%. Still a lot of people say to wait and not cause a bank run by themselves. (anyway we had over $6b withdrawals just in the past three days.)\n\n4. FTT falls nearly 50% as panic is at its peak with many being certain over a LUNA-like collapse.\n\n5. Plot-twist of the decade, CZ says to get ready to acquire FTX. Now FTX is nearly down - 89% and BTC is down - 15% with most alts down - 20%. BTC is also at new fresh lows of this bear market.\n\nThat's just a lot. And it's not in any way everything that happened. Now who is the bad one here? The funny thing is both are clearly wrong here. SBF was running two companies (FTX and Alameda Research) to systematically print himself millions. CZ has made a proper plan to cause panic and decrease FTX market value to eventually purchase their competitor.\n\nThat's just peak crypto. Volatile as hell, a hundred things happen in a few days or even hours, billionaires don't really care about us customers but are placing a their own game and so on...

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":1782,"selftext":"This should go without saying but it needs to be said. Billionaires are not our friends. *Somehow* these people manage to amass cult followings who hang on their every word almost like Gospel. Many of us have come to crypto for financial freedom and uses where conventional finance has failed us. Heck, even if you are just here for the profits these people are still very bad source of advice and trust in them is misplaced trust.\n\nI could start with SBF who seems to be intent on acquiring every single crypto company and absolutely crush the competition using what seems to be(or used to be) his unlimited bank account for unlimited buying power. He has also recently come out with some very anti-decentralization statements. Speaking of decentralization we move to CZ who has built up an image of being very pro-decentralization and yet skirts around and avoids the entire issue when it's asked about regarding BSC. On the [Binance blog](https:\/\/www.binance.com\/en\/blog\/from-cz\/cz-on-centralization-vs-decentralization-2022-4766586322749082372) he claims that \"decentralization is a gradient scale\" and refuses to describe Binance's chain as centralized when **only 19 validators are needed** to alter or outright freeze the chain completely as we saw recently. Further, any and all validators are **chosen by Binance** themselves. Binance has also been involved in many cases of either [attempting skirt around](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/investigates\/special-report\/fintech-crypto-binance-zhao\/) or outright just [ignoring regulatory laws](https:\/\/twitter.com\/wsj\/status\/1458804234279960577?lang=en) while at the same time CZ speaks warmly about the benefits and positivity of regulations.\n\nElon Musk outright manipulates markets to his whim and fancy and seems to find it a fun game that he partakes in  gleefully as investors may lose their life savings, futures and family funds. He talks a big game about free speech but has started permanently suspending accounts that \"impersonate others\", which are generally actually obvious account parodies especially those done to him. He also plays a certain segment of crypto \"investors\" like fiddles who pump the market and get dumped on when he \"doesn't follow through\" on a tweet and heavily suggest ideas he has no intention of implementing.\n\nI don't think I need to mention the likes of Do Kwon, Alex Mashinsky and John Karony as well as know their deviousness all too well. On this particular note we should realise an important step in DYOR. NEVER invest in any token or platform that has a single individual as the face of the entire company, usually the founder or CEO as the face of the company. All of these people are only here to feed their own ego, and use the veneer of crypto \"freedom\" to attract those already holding resentment toward traditional finance to gain their blind trust. They are here for the cash and the attention. If nothing else, find yourself a platform or product with a CEO\/head whose keeps his\/her head down and puts in the work and doesn't have to tweet every hour for validation.\n\nThis trickles further down into investment based on \"endorsements\" from celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Floyd Mayweather and Tom Brady. You can even include Matt Damon in this as while it was an \"above-board\" paid ad, he was 100% using his name and influence to promote crypto and should clearly know the risks and backlash that it could bring but he seems to have blindly sold out for the money.\n\nRecent market events have also shown that we give these people way too much power. I saw a comment on the sub that said it's actually not a bad thing if Cefi collapses, as Defi would take over. A *very* interesting statement.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yq1b7g\/billionaires_like_sbf_cz_musk_are_not_our_friends\/","author":"OneThatNoseOne","num_comments":509,"created_utc":1667948153000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"Billionaires like SBF, CZ, Musk Are Not Our Friends And Never Will Be","distinguished":null,"id":"yq1b7g","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":6,"selftext":"Most of you probably noticed that today was a crazy day in crypto. Beside massive dumps it was super volatile, partly even in green, just to dump straight back.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d6g9x8rvoty91.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a95b45db034f5cecfea5176a3109d4708d3cf975\n\nThe biggest indicator for today's price movement was the big FTX drama. You can find more information in the [FTX megathread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ypl4a9\/ftx_megathread\/)\n\n# Crypto Event\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[SPY &amp; BTC comparison chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/01b0mu70qty91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4192f04d7c5937080918cb90169d9d3c1bb0519e)\n\nIn the chart above you see a direct comparison of the SPY ( S&amp;P 500 index ) compared with Bitcoin. You can clearly see the similarities through all the months. Usually, crypto followed the stock market but that abruptly changed today. In fact the stock markets were mostly green today.\n\n# FTT ( FTX token ) dropped over -75% after the exchange news\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0vb3szvhyty91.png?width=1890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2013b072ea6874363091e42564dcda71f2dca835\n\n# SOLANA dropped -33% within 3 days losing trust over the binance x FTX news\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/oaw8ln7zyty91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ace1fb1f2aa9a83b00fe3f0738ea28989455d67e\n\n# market cap fell over -118 billion in a single day\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/iyxjhbwoqty91.png?width=1898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13795c3f6a87d362d06890af89f080044f191841\n\nIt dropped from $1.037.809.674.346 to $919.380.800.505 .Not the lowest it has been this year ( 825 billion 19th june ) but -12% is still a big difference.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# But why?\n\nBeside the huge impact of the fall of FTX and it's token FTT ( and the related Solana dump ) the entire topic is pretty clear : FTX messed up. And when one of the largest exchanges with one of the best reputations falls like that it's a **big hit to the trust in crypto. And I'm not just talking about the investor trust but also the politics behind it**. There has been a lot of bills they tried to push for crypto that are most likely dead now. This is putting crypto in a bad spot and view from governments around the world which is enough for institutions \/ whales to cash out and move their funds out of crypto.\n\n# What about the future?\n\nAs I mentioned above one of the main reason for the dump is the lack of trust. And it is important to keep in mind that the global economics are in a really bad shape. Inflation is still not under control, war, shortages &amp; other factors keep having a negative impact on the world economics.The recession we are in for months starts showing it's impact as well. Bad earning reports for bluechip stocks and lay offs everywhere. And when it comes to interest rate hikes the federal reserve made it very clear that a it is \"very premature to think about pausing\".\n\nAdditionally, [CPI release is coming on the 10th november](https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/schedule\/news_release\/cpi.htm) that always caused volatility in the crypto markets. The release will most likely have a huge impact on the stock market if not even decide the direction for the next week and crypto will follow it. Safe to say the volatility will be huge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[september CPI release chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w70wev8avty91.png?width=751&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cac5be30fdfc6c776011a073bb70ff82ece4c52)\n\n[october CPI release chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6y4ls8xdvty91.png?width=824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e960e0da45f6a9dfa817eca00cae77be4643cc8e)\n\n**quick Bitcoin technical analysis ( just numbers - no crystal ball no worries )**\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ewck0dbqwty91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82df31fc7cf728dc1424e0f9266e60c701cdc981\n\nToday Bitcoin fell through the lowest value of the bear market to a level of 2020. But the support was strong enough to push it back into the $18000 range and even further above. The volume spiked to a new high of  760.367k in a day. Bitcoin dominance remains above 40%.\n\nGenerally speaking the support in crypto is still strong even after such a blackswan event. But the next days \/ weeks will be very important if it keeps holding. Some see it as a fire sale, some take the chance to trade and for some it was the last push to exit the market.\n\n**TL;DR** : It's been a chaotic day and crypto prices took a heavy hit. **The fundamentals haven't changed**. But the next days \/ weeks will be interesting. It's impossible to speculate if this was another bottom hit and will recover from here or if prices will continue to fall. CPI and the stock markets will most likely be a key indicator for this.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yq58tt\/crypto_markets_a_quick_recap\/","author":"TarkovReddit0r","num_comments":16,"created_utc":1667958624000,"edited":1667958854000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANALYSIS","title":"Crypto markets - a quick recap","distinguished":null,"id":"yq58tt","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":2,"selftext":"So this little thought is brought on by the obvious issue of the day being the awesome times that a big \"Regulated\" CEX is having at the moment, and the obvious kind of knock on for any individual in the Crypto space is \"Why are we using a CEX? We are crypto right? RIGHT!?\"  \n\n\nBut I do not think it is that straight forward. There is quite a bit of capital that will still opt for a CEX even though they are trading supposedly decentralised trustless assets.\n\n**Regulations**\n\nThe corporate suits\/flipflops, whichever your flavour, probably have their own regulations, and a part of that is that they only use services that are regulated. A regulation virus. The irony here is also palpable. As Erik Voorhees so aptly put it in his recent discussion with Sam BF, the actual crypto infrastructure is more open and auditable than anything that has been built in traditional finance. The parts of the crypto space that actually need regulation are the centralized entities, and we have just seen that it does not even actually work to provide the protections it supposedly provides. Never the less - regulated institutions will still have some push to used regulated services. [Defi section of Voorhees vs SBF](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Ytaa_5liwMA?t=3133)\n\n**Market Implementation**\n\nCEXs have order books and DEXs have pools. They facilitate the swapping of one asset for another, but in different ways. Many traders know and love the order book, and there are many existing tools and techniques for interacting with an order book that can be brought over from the traditional finance sector. This is not to say different tools for Pools exist and are getting built, but if you are coming from existing finance, an Order Book is home. The nature of smart contracts on a blockchain, and the speed and cost of execution is the main limiting factor for an Order Book not being built in a DEX, but that might change or already be changing with projects like [Serum](https:\/\/www.projectserum.com\/).\n\n**Depth and Liquidity**\n\nCEXs have more depth and liquidity. That is it. But this is something that can and is changing? I feel like I have seen some graph showing the growth of DEX depth and liquidity compared to CEX, and it is growing faster? Don't quote me on that one - will add a link if someone points one out.  \n\n\nSo that is it, my set of reasons people still turn to a CEX despite the hacks, rugs, and incompetence. And so, I feel as if both will exist for the forseeable future. But the advantages of a DEX are getting taught to everyone very well by the operators of CEXs.  \n\n\nAnyone else got thoughts on the future of these 2 options?","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yqaha4\/to_cex_or_to_dex_some_thoughts_on_who_might_want\/","author":"BinaryMonkL","num_comments":22,"created_utc":1667974387000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"To CEX or to DEX, some thoughts on who might want to play where.","distinguished":null,"id":"yqaha4","downs":null,"ups":null}

If your coins got stuck, too bad for you. And to add insult to injury, the fuckers also decided to dox their customers. And now FTX is on the brink of death as well and we learn the value of this very important lesson.\n2. **DONT CATCH A FALLING KNIFE** \\- We see this time and time again. You bought the dip, and the dip just kept on dipping. Thats not to say you shouldnt buy the dip, just know what youre doing and realize that there is a high chance the price will go even lower. \n3. **DONT TRY TO TIME THE MARKET; DCA WORKS** \\- Once again the crypto space showed some insane volatility. Some coins are literally down 50-70% in 24 hours. You minimize the effect of this volatility on your portfolio through constant DCA. Just close your eyes and buy no matter the price. Its very likely to work in the long term.\n4. **THE MARKET GIVETH AND THE MARKET TAKETH AWAY ; STOP FOMO-ing** \\- Got hyped into buying MATIC and\/or DOGE last week?

In order for the medium to grow beyond that perception, we need to establish trust between the general public and the institutions that operate in the space.\n\nSo far we've had:\n\n**Binance:** Outages during large price drops, leaving traders unable to sell. Potential monopolistic control over the space if they acquire FTX. The wider Binance vs. FTX fiasco as it evolves.\n\n**Crypto.com:** Rumors of financial trouble have been spurred by the routine slashing of card, staking and fee benefits on the platform. These changes have widely been made without warning, even notifying users of the changes *after* they've been made. Add this to CEO Kris Marszalek's [history of cutting and running](https:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/cryptocom-ceo-kris-marszalek-had-messy-past-before-staples-center-renaming), allegations of fraud, and sentiment around CDC is far from positive now - Matt Damon be damned.\n\n**Coinbase:** Rumors of insolvency (seemingly unfounded) and a reputation for \"undergoing maintenance\" or leaving users unable to withdraw during large price movements (not unfounded).\n\n**Kucoin:** Rumors of insolvency, though these seem unfounded right now.\n\nIn any case, the fact that one of the largest exchanges in the space, FTX, a company worth *billions* of dollars, can be crippled by 240 characters or less does not bode well for the space. Not every investor will have the technical knowhow to truly *use* crypto, at least right now, but we are reliant on greater investment in the space for widespread adoption to occur. If new money views even the most powerful entities in the space as houses-of-cards or shady enterprises that could be dissolved at any moment, there's no way crypto will ever grow beyond the worst aspects of its reputation.\n\nYes, *you should get your coins off of exchanges and take self-custody of your finances*, but you shouldn't ***have to***. CEXs are on-ramps into crypto for the vast majority of investors who enter the space. We may not like it here, but they - and their figureheads - are representatives of crypto. If none of them can be trusted not to collapse, manipulate the market, run away with funds or exploit their userbase, how can we expect new investors to trust the space as a whole?","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yqm8v9\/like_it_or_not_we_need_robust_trustworthy_cexs\/","author":"reaglesham","num_comments":17,"created_utc":1668008024000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"Like it or not, we need robust, trustworthy CEXs for crypto to thrive","distinguished":null,"id":"yqm8v9","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":11,"selftext":"The events of the past 48 hours, as well as this year, have damaged the crypto industry severely and set everything back at least a couple of years. However, it should be noted that a vast majority of these events are exogenous to crypto itself and are caused by actions that go against the ethos of crypto to begin with.\n\nDisregarding hacks, scams, and rug pulls for a second (most of these are  due to bad security or malicious intent), the biggest contagion events in crypto this year have been the collapse of Terra, Three Arrows Capital and now FTX\/Alameda. Two of those, 3AC  and FTX, are centralized entities that went completely against the crypto ethos of transparency and permissionless actions. Honestly, you can even argue that this is the case with Terra as well. 3AC and FTX both allegedly engaged in reckless directional trading of unsecured loans without appropriate hedging. The biggest issue with the collapse of such entities is the contagion effect that they pose to other actors within the space. Numerous trading desks, firms and investors that have material exposure to these actors end up being wiped out of the market. \n\nCrypto has long sought to disrupt the banking industry, which was deemed too opaque and secretive. However, it seems that these large centralized entities go completely against the crypto ethos of transparency and end up shooting themselves in the foot.\n\nI believe that in the long term, the events that transpired this year are bullish for DeFi and self-custody. As seen during 3AC and Celsius' collapse, the first loans that get paid down are those issued by DeFi protocols. Loans on platforms such as Maker and AAVE cannot be influenced by external factors and simply rely on the logic of code. On chain data can be verified at any point in time by anyone on block explorers or by node operators. During the market downturns, all DeFi loans and liquidations have worked as intended as  they are overcollateralized and permissionless. Although DeFi at its current state is far from capital efficient, it allows market participants to not be affected by the greed of individuals as much as with centralized entities.\n\nI hope that recent events push at least a few people to move towards self-custody and to rely fully on on-chain services, rather than centralized entities that continuously prove to be incompatible with the crypto ethos.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yqq0jp\/the_crypto_industry_keeps_repeating_the_mistakes\/","author":"LieutenantZucc","num_comments":28,"created_utc":1668016058000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"The Crypto Industry Keeps Repeating the Mistakes of the Industry it Sought to Destroy","distinguished":null,"id":"yqq0jp","downs":null,"ups":null}

They are sorta sister companies. Market makers on FTX. And possibly hold\/trade customer deposits. The relationship has been unclear for years. (achilles heel?) \n*  But most people think of FTX as a blue chip company. Sam is famous. He's a genius right?   They wait for he or alemeda to show they are in good health  \n*  Sam tweets saying everything is \"fine\"   but it feels to all of crypto like a girlfriend saying \"i'm fine\"   but she's not fine. \n*  Alemeda's CEO comes out and says they will \"happily\" buy the FTT token as it plunges   But something tells us that it's not so happy, even with the exclamation mark \n*  24 hours pass  if they had the financial strength, they would have shown it by now  This starts to feel like the \"steady lads\" moment right before luna collapsed \n*  People freak out. start withdrawing funds from FTX.

We *may buy* them to save them\"   Binance basically started a rumor, made a threat, and ended up buying its biggest competitor overnight.  \n*  For now the drama ends.   crypto crisis averted  if ftx failed...that would have been devastating for all of crypto \n\n**Buuuuut the drama most certainly doesn't end...**\n\n*  The affair with FTX\/Alameda is not over, and the market is worrying it could get much worse.  And yes, it can! \n*  I think this is an honest assessment.  My take:  CZ was pissed, like many, at SBF for bullying Congress to write the crypto bill to favor FTX and against the larger crypto industry.  CZ wanted to embarrass SBF, not kill him off in this manner. \n*  So, when it came to light that sketchy things were going on between FTX and Alameda, CZ moved to \"muzzle\" SBF, to get him to back off on the money he was spreading around DC to personally write the crypto bill. \n*  What CZ did not anticipate, and is now apparent, is how SBF squandered his trust in the industry.   So, at the first sign of trouble, everyone ran.   And they took a CZ's statement of displeasure over SBF and turned it into a wipeout that sunk FTX\/Alameda in two days. \n*  The big question now is, does CZ\/Binance follow through and acquire FTX?   Remember they only signed a NON-BINDING letter of Intent subject to due diligence.  If they do, the counter-party risk is mitigated. \n*  **If not, a lot of people (read: other brokers, hedge funds institutional investors, in addition to retail degens) have FTX accounts, and if they cannot get their money out, they are in trouble.

As I write, it is breaking below $17k.  This signals the market is very worried CZ\/Binance will not acquire FTX. \n*  The problem is centralized exchanges\/brokers. They are inherently unstable and prone to blow up. They do in tradfi all the time (2008, 2011 MF Global, 2020).  But they have the central bank money printer, and governments with taxing power, and large armies to backstop them. \n*  The answer is true DeFi.   But I fear DC will think the answer is to make DeFi harder and push everything toward CeFi and impose tradfi regulations on them.

The tech of your project didn't change, the crypto didn't turn to ponzi overnight. Maybe we have reached the bottom maybe we didn't, it doesn't matter, we're here for the long run.\n\nThere will appear some posts about how flawed BTC or ETH or any other big coin is, there will be opinions that crypto is never gonna recover from this or much worse.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":10,"selftext":"  \n\nBinancians, \n\nGiven the events that transpired over the last coupe of days. I want to reiterate a few points.\n\nOne, we did not master plan this or anything related to it. It was less than 24 hrs ago that SBF called me. And before that, I had very little knowledge of the internal state of things at FTX. I could do some mental calculations with our revenues and guess theirs, but it would never be very accurate. I was surprised when he wanted to talk. My first reaction was, he wants to do an OTC deal\u2026 But here we are.\n\nTwo, as the due diligence for the deal is on-going, I want to remind everyone: DO NOT trade FTT tokens. If you have a bag, you have a bag. DO NOT buy or sell. As soon as I finished the call with SBF yesterday, I asked our team to stop selling as an organization. Yes, we have a bag. But that\u2019s ok. More importantly, we need to hold ourselves to a higher standard than even in banks. \n\nThree, obviously, do not comment on the deal, publicly or internally. If you are not directly involved, don\u2019t ask. We have got a good team handling it. Things will play out.\n\nFour, FTX going down is not good for anyone in the industry. Do not view it as a \u201cwin for us\u201d. User confidence is severely shaken. Regulators will scrutinize exchanges even more. Licenses around the globe will be harder to get. And people now think we are the biggest and will attack us more. But that\u2019s OK, we are used to being open and leaning into headwinds. In fact, we embrace scrutiny. We must significantly increase our transparency, proof-of-reserves, insurance funds, etc. A lot more to come in this area. We have a lot of tough work ahead of us. Not to mention prices swinging wildly.\n\nFive, speaking of prices. As I have said many times over the years, ignore the prices.

Instead, they should be demanding more transparency and responsibility. How many collapses will it take? Do users think that FTX is really the only company playing these games right now?\n\nMore than ever before, crypto has been in the spotlight of lawmakers and regulators. This isn't a niche and small sub-$1 billion market anymore. Crypto is spreading everywhere; financial institutions, major corporations, and governments are all jumping on board or taking sides. And we want them to be on the pro-crypto side.

At peak, trillions of dollars are at stake. Unfortunately, the time to shake bad actors was ten years ago.\n\nThese repeated, large-scale, industry and market-defining events could do much more long-term harm to crypto than good, especially during a time of heightened regulatory scrutiny. A decade after its collapse, the media still references Mt. Gox. How will this year's events look going forward?\n\nWhen someone like Sam Bankman-Fried, one of the faces defending and supporting crypto to U.S. government lawmakers, is simultaneously using this space to conduct questionable and high-risk actions to rake in billions of dollars, it's stripping away the industry's credibility.\n\nThese people are not crypto users' friends. They are not looking out for the small guy's pocket. Most of them are simply trying to accumulate as much wealth as they can in the fastest manner possible. And they are all likely [connected much more closely than you may think](https:\/\/protos.com\/ftx-and-tether-were-closer-to-celsius-than-anyone-realized\/).\n\nWe're not talking about Satoshi Nakamoto or decentralized protocols or true innovators here; we're talking about centralized, institutional-level control asserted over the crypto industry. When these entities strip away some fundamental attributes (trustlessness, transparency, accessibility, decentralization) that make crypto game-changing while simultaneously holding power to speak to regulators on crypto's behalf or shift the market, the crypto community should demand more.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yqw39x\/the_collapse_of_irresponsible_crypto_companies_is\/","author":"Uglarknog","num_comments":23,"created_utc":1668029243000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"PERSPECTIVE","title":"The Collapse of Irresponsible Crypto Companies is Bad for the Industry in the Long-Run","distinguished":null,"id":"yqw39x","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":74,"selftext":"Hey there crypto community, I wanted to give you all a brief update on what has happened the last few days in the crypto markets and what this clash means for the industry at large.\n\n \\- A feud between SBF (Founder FTX, 2nd largest crypto exchange in the world) and CZ (Founder of Binance, largest crypto exchange) became public. It started out with some weird Twitter fights, but (d)evolved into serious accusations, with CZ accusing SBF to lobby against Crypto and Binance in the US (to basically regulate crypto in his favor), spreading false rumors about Binance to journalists and general shady practices - Balance sheets of Alameda (a hedge fund founded by SBF, with close ties to FTX) were published, showing an unhealthy mix of illiquid assets (FTT - FTX Exchange token) and loans. \n\n\\- The feud escalated when CZ publicly announced he would start dumping his FTT tokens on the market (he holds more than $500m in assets, which obviously means the FTT market would dump) after he became \u201cworried\u201d about FTX and Alameda\u2019s relationship and their overall financial standing. Obviously this was a direct attack to SBF, which started the unwinding of his entire business empire. \n\n\\- This statement by CZ freaked out the market, and a bank run on FTX started, with billions in assets being withdrawn in a short period of time. At first it seemed like FTX would be able to handle this liquidity crunch and stresstest because why wouldn\u2019t they? Their Founder was supposed to be one of the smartest and richest ($15B+ net worth) in Crypto. But yesterday it started to become apparent that the worries about irregularities in FTX financial stability were actually true, and that FTX wasn\u2019t just illiquid, they were entirely insolvent. \n\n\\- While SBF was trying to raise emergency funding ($1B yesterday morning), the hole grew too big ($5B+) by midday yesterday, that he was faced with either declaring bankruptcy, or going for a savior - which ended up being Binance, the one they so fiercely attacked. This was the \u201cHoly shit\u201d moment across the industry: [https:\/\/twitter.com\/SBF\\_FTX\/status\/1590012124864348160](https:\/\/twitter.com\/SBF_FTX\/status\/1590012124864348160) \n\n\\- As became public just now, Binance turned down the takeover bid because the hole in FTX is too big (rmored to be around $8B). It will take weeks if not months to really find out the truth of SBF and FTX\u2019s behavior, but the most likely explanation right now is that SBF was using client funds on FTX to bailout his hedge fund (Alameda) and potentially make other equity investments [https:\/\/twitter.com\/lucasnuzzi\/status\/1590122590206824448?s=46&amp;t=5j0a0fmPfIlyvOqaGFy6Yg](https:\/\/twitter.com\/lucasnuzzi\/status\/1590122590206824448?s=46&amp;t=5j0a0fmPfIlyvOqaGFy6Yg) \n\n\\- The most likely next step for FTX will be declaring bankruptcy, and then going through the same bankruptcy process as Mt. Gox, Celsius, etc. to help recover user funds through a long legal process.\n\n Quite frankly, nobody expected this. Many smart investors and people were caught off guard and have lost a lot of money by trusting the wrong people yet again. One of the key industry figures turned out to be nothing more than a fraudster - doesn\u2019t sound too uncommon does it? After Three Arrows Capital (hedge fund that blew up with $5b+ in client funds), Celsius ($10b+ in user funds lost), Luna\/Terra ($60b+ stablecoin that blew up) we now have FTX (unknown how much was lost, but was probably more than $6b+) and Alameda that also blew up. The emperor has no clothes - always. Those who were most vocal about their genius, wealth and superiority in this industry ended up being the catalysts for some of the greatest failures in business history. SBF erased $15 Billion from his own wealth (largest single day % drop in relative wealth in history), billions in investments from VCs and most likely more in client funds (hopefully they will be saved\u2026). In the end, the market humbles all of us - especially those who stand at the top.  \n \n\n\\- This is a very sad mark in the history of Crypto. Many of us joined crypto because we wanted to replace the established system of abuses of power, centralized ownership and  hidden dealings to profit a few. Instead, we got all the same and even worse - billions of user funds were lost by misplacing our trust. We should never blindly trust anyone - and we should never give them too much power. Power will always be abused. \n\n\\- Centralized platforms are the weakest point of Crypto, but they also remain the most essential lifeline. They allow for liquidity to enter and leave our ecosystem, which is crucial for our growth. As an industry, we seriously need to think about how we approach this on-boarding \/ off-boarding in a better, more transparent and maybe even trust-free way. Proof of Reserves is a good start for exchanges and stablecoins, but we need to go much further to really build a trustless, resilient ecosystem.\n\n\\- Binance is the largest and most dominant player in the Crypto market. They control 90% of the spot market volume. This sheer market size means that abuses of power by Binance are inevitable (and they have happened in the past). Regulations of CEX\u2019es will only increase now, and we should prepare for that. \n\n\\- Crypto is so much more than just making money. All the people that joined Crypto in pursuit of personal gains ended up failing spectacularly. In the end, it\u2019s all about belief in technology and the impact we can have with it. Those who are motivated by money are tourists on our journey.

A 15 min lesson is all you need. \n\n- ITS NOT WORTH IT FOR THE ANOUNT OF CRYPTO I HAVE: your btc mightn\u2019t be worth much now but it probably will in time to come. If you dca or plan on buying more, it certainly worth it. \n\n- ITS A WASTE OF MONEY TRANSFERRING IT TO ANOTHER WALLET- its actually pretty cheap.

Always buy the wallet from an official source. Never buy a second hand wallet. Don\u2019t use if the seal is damaged. The wallet should generate a new seed phrase, never use one that comes with a seed phrase. Write down the seed phrase and keep it safe. Never save the seed phrase in your phone or computer.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yr0nmw\/to_the_people_that_still_leave_their_crypto_on_an\/","author":"fuzzyduck88","num_comments":98,"created_utc":1668040922000,"edited":1668042328000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ADVICE","title":"To the people that still leave their crypto on an exchange: why?","distinguished":null,"id":"yr0nmw","downs":null,"ups":null}

Well, Cardano is humming along just fine. Cardano also dumped a bit but it's definitely not beholden to whales like FTX.\n\nWhat's the lesson here? Maybe diversify a bit into decentralized blockchains like Cardano. We are still building, projects are coming out with new developments everyday, and more people are joining by the minute. This goes for the NFT market as well as other markets within Cardano.\n\nAs Defi continues to unfold first with stable-coins we will see a boom in Cardano. So stay tuned. The party is not over yet for the so called \"ghost chain.\"\n\nThis will be an unpopular thing to say but I'd say Cardano is just as resilient as the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum and has proven itself in that regard.

Full transparency.\n&gt; \n&gt; https:\/\/nitter.net\/cz_binance\/status\/1590055819416330240\n\n___\n&gt; JUST IN: Exchanges OKX, KuCoin, Poloniex and Huobi to do proof of reserves, letting users verify whether their #Bitcoin funds are actually there\nhttps:\/\/nitter.net\/PatriotiD1\/status\/1590326434748592130\n\n&gt; We share the belief that it should be necessary for crypto platforms to publicly share proof of reserves and Crypto.com will be publishing our audited proof of reserves.\nhttps:\/\/nitter.net\/kris\/status\/1590504912974417921\n\nI applaud CZ for calling things by its name. But: CZ has things upside down (probably out of personal interest which has to do with running the biggest CEX).\n\nAlthough I would certainly look forward to have some more or less reliable proof-or-reserves (PoR), I do think that fractional reserve is a naturally occurring and inevitable development when centralized parties accumulate money. Speculating with and re-investing your customer's funds simply translate into a direct competitive advantage for CEX (at least as long as things run smoothly and the assumptions of demand are within safety margins). Satoshi taught us to take game theory into account when creating economic systems. That's why I think any \"proof\" is better than what we have today, but it will be a hard one to deliver on. Things will still be game-able (albeit\/ideally to a lesser degree). Those who develop the skills to game the audits will still be better off at the cost of everybody else. The real solution to fractionally reserved CEX is much more easy. **Advocating self custody!**\n\n&gt; #Self custody &gt; Proof of reserves\nhttps:\/\/nitter.net\/cakewallet\/status\/1590119957387280384\n\nI want you to remind  that all CEX are not holy (they either have massive regulatory risk like Coinbase or Kraken) or they are unregulated and have risks from trading against their customers, engage in naked shorting or run [fractional reserve schemes](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yce4s3\/fractional_reserve_is_back_a_critical_examination\/).\n\nMost of us are still waiting for answers from the last Binance AMA. Actually the most upvoted questions have not been answered at all. Maybe we can get some answers from you directly \/u\/cpzhao\n\nLink to the **Binance AMA**: https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/y74xc8\/ama_binancecom_product_team_here_ask_us_anything\/\n\n&gt; * Do you run fractional reserve on Monero?

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":2,"selftext":"Title, not financial advice. I'm going to provide a \"bullish case\" and a \"bearish case\", then I'll let you guys decide which one you think we could be in, or if we are somewhere in the middle.              \n\nSomething to clarify for the time being: one of the top 10 exchanges (FTX) declaring insolvency is one of the main reasons why this leg down happened. However, it has always been my contention that the ATL from the ATH that we saw last year (at least in terms of percentages), should not be as \"severe\" as that which we saw from EOY 2017 to EOY 2018. Why do I say this? **Stablecoins**.                \n\n**Bearish Case:**               \nThis historical snapshot from coinmarketcap will tell you that literally almost exactly 4 years ago today (a few days off) we began a big leg down that eventually took us to a low of about 3100 USD: https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/lSWRKVX                   \n\nThere are rumors surrounding Solana right now, but crypto dot com has halted deposits and withdrawals of solana to their exchange, I was never interested in investing in it, and I have nothing bad or good to say about the guys who made it. I usually just sit back and watch how this all takes place and effects markets, then I put my buy into btc and eth.                      \n\nWe could go lower, we could stay right where we are. I can't tell you. Back then, however, there were essentially two events that triggered this: Bitmex trading against their own users and the \"fork war\" that was going on between BCH and BSV fans (or at least, that's what many people speculated was the problem back then).               \n\nTL;DR for the bearish case is, \"There could be a domino effect that's about to take place. We just need to know what is going to be that next domino.\"\n\n**The Bullish Case:**               \nI've mentioned before in other threads that I created that back in 2018, there were not as many stablecoins in the market as there are today.                       \n\nHistorical snapshot: https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/I1laTic - the market cap of tether back then was less than 1% of bitcoin's market cap. Now, compare that to the modern day market cap of USDT, USDC, and BUSD, and that is equal to about $135 billion USD of stablecoins: https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/q9JEIX1                      \n\nAdmittedly, a massive chunk of these stablecoins are very likely locked up on DEXes to assist in providing liquidity for certain trading pairs, but I reckon a great deal of it is also meant to act as \"dry powder\" that is ready to buy more bitcoin and other coins on the way down.                  \n\n\nIn either case, BTC dominance should be rising soon.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yrc2jf\/if_we_were_to_draw_an_equivalency_to_the_bear\/","author":"sgtslaughterTV","num_comments":10,"created_utc":1668079655000,"edited":1668079863000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"PERSPECTIVE","title":"If we were to draw an equivalency to the bear market of EOY 2018 (almost exactly 4 years ago), my gut feeling is that we are at 2018's 5,000-5500 USD range and could still be on the way down.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":8,"selftext":"We have to get something clear. SBF did this himself and caused the fall of all his firms. It is pretty simple that users should be able to deposit funds and withdraw their funds with no fear of losses, because there *aren't supposed* to be any losses. Exchanges are supposed to make money off fees and nothing more. And the way people trade, they should have been able to do just fine off of that. Even in the bear market, lay-off staff as Crypto.com did although they did get a hell of flak for it, it's much better than burning cash and having users lose everything. Even the way Crypto.com slashed card rewards and some APY as well, is much more sustainable than....whatever SBF did. Of course that doesn't excuse Crypto.com from over-hiring, improperly managing the staff and resources, making false promises to users, spending boatloads on advertising and assuming a bear market would never come, but I digress. I want to stay on topic.\n\nThen there is Binance and CZ. While SBF did this himself, two things can be true at the same time. CZ 100% knew what he was doing by de-listing and liquidating FTT. This 100% was a cut-throat business practice and CZ will absolutely use it to gain more market share. Let us remember that this is the same Binance CEO that that strongly advocates for decentralization but [refuses to admit](https:\/\/www.binance.com\/en\/blog\/from-cz\/cz-on-centralization-vs-decentralization-2022-4766586322749082372) that 19 validators on BSC  *that are chosen by Binance in the first place* makes it centralized, and instead calls decentralization \" operating on a gradient scale\". The same CZ that speaks so warmly about encourages regulation but [attempt skirt around](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/investigates\/special-report\/fintech-crypto-binance-zhao\/) or outright just [ignoring regulatory laws](https:\/\/twitter.com\/wsj\/status\/1458804234279960577?lang=en). The same man who wrote [a WHOLE BLOG about having ethics and being fair](https:\/\/www.binance.com\/en\/blog\/from-cz\/czs-principles-6343713009794494746) but whose company has over 50% market share that they obtained their certainly unethical and outright illegal practices according to many state authorities. And who is going to gobble up way more market share in this collapse. He may have assisted in exposing and collapsing a scheme but it was 100% for self-gain as he and his company's history so clearly proves. \n\nCZ isn't a hero for exposing a scam. I am also not sure that CZ probably is even really a villain out to steal your money and leave you with nothing. After all, he is happy with you having money so you long as you trade on *his* platform paying fees and keep him rich. No, I think CZ is just another rich billionaire looking to get even richer through whatever ways he can. Just another billionaire who will never be our friend.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yrcguc\/so_binance_ceo_cz_is_a_hero_a_villain_or\/","author":"OneThatNoseOne","num_comments":34,"created_utc":1668080723000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"So Binance CEO CZ Is A Hero, A Villain Or Something Else","distinguished":null,"id":"yrcguc","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":10,"selftext":"As of now we see some things unfold which I believe will have in the short short term a negative impact on price movements. \n\n1.) the SBF drama has been talked a lot already and still will be. But to get a realistic grasp on the situation we still need more information. This will take a minute to truly unfold. \n\n2.) Stable coins used to be widely respected and accepted for being a safe storage with nice interests compared to storing money in the bank. Now with rumours of multiple exchanges who issued a stable coin didn\u2019t peg those properly. Another dump for crypto might just be a matter of time if more stable coins will fail do to their massive collateral stored in them. \n\n3.) The Tech industry in general had a bad year in terms of valuation loss. It felt a bit strange to see so many big companies suddenly wanting to adopt it. This feels a little bit too coincidental but don\u2019t ask me what goal they had in mind. I\u2019m too dumb for that and just wore my tin foil hat for this point. I\u2019m taking it off again. \n\n4.) So much change in sentiment in the last couple weeks is even for crypto pretty volatile. As I\u2019m writing this post a few coins are already back on track. Some are close to reaching their value before the SBF drama started. With all that I think it\u2019s not a bad idea to keep holding to some fiat for the time being until the markets calm down a bit. \n\nI think in the span of 1-2 years most of us will have a green portfolio again. \n\nNo pain no gain","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yrdfgx\/we_havent_reached_the_bottom_of_this_bear_market\/","author":"Sidibadawiin","num_comments":35,"created_utc":1668083214000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"PERSPECTIVE","title":"We haven\u2019t reached the bottom of this bear market yet","distinguished":null,"id":"yrdfgx","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":54,"selftext":"In the last 24hrs a bunch of Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) and Custodial services have started publishing their current holdings. In an attempt to reassure customers and investors about their solvency. Let me be 100% clear this dosn't mean shit \n\nAt the start of the week FTX on the books also had enough reserves (in theory) to cover its creditors. Namely deposited funds. In less than 3 days that illusion was quickly broken. This is because of 2 things \n\n1. Using Crypto as collateral against fiat based debts \n2. Overvaluation of those assets on the books \n\n\nA CEX may show they have (in theory) enough crypto to payback customers at 1:1 of that crypto. But this isn't at 1:1 against the $,\u20ac or \u00a3. You could have bought at $100 and get at $1 but you will get your crypto \n\nHowever as stated in (1) most of these CEX debts are in fiat. So if they took a loan at $100 (over collateralized 2:1so $200 for $100) and the price is now $1. They are in the hole $98. They can give the customer back the crypto at 1:1 but they are still insolvent as they have a debt of $98 outstanding \n\nSo even if they have $50 of bluechip currently and now $2 of their CEX token. They will not be able to pay you back as they will even after using depositors funds be $48 in the hole!\n\nThis is why they have been doing (2) over valuations of their in house tokens. By doing this they can create an illusion of solvency. E.g if you have a $30 billion loan in $ for a stable coin. You can just say your in house coin is worth $400 rather than current price of $270. If you have 58 million of these tokens you look solvent.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":45,"selftext":"Pasting tweets below:\n\n 1) I'm sorry.  That's the biggest thing.  I fucked up, and should have done better. \n\n 2) I also should have been communicating more very recently.  Transparently--my hands were tied during the duration of the possible Binance deal; I wasn't particularly allowed to say much publicly.  But of course it's on me that we ended up there in the first place. \n\n 3) So here's an update on where things are.  \\[THIS IS ALL ABOUT FTX INTERNATIONAL, THE NON-US EXCHANGE.  FTX US USERS ARE FINE!\\]  \\[TREAT ALL OF THESE NUMBERS AS ROUGH.  THERE ARE APPROXIMATIONS HERE.\\] \n\n 4) FTX International currently has a total market value of assets\/collateral higher than client deposits (moves with prices!).  But that's different from liquidity for delivery--as you can tell from the state of withdrawals.  The liquidity varies widely, from very to very little. \n\n 5) The full story here is one I'm still fleshing out every detail of, but as a very high level, I fucked up twice.  The first time, a poor internal labeling of bank-related accounts meant that I was substantially off on my sense of users' margin.  I thought it was way lower. \n\n 6) My sense before:  Leverage: 0x USD liquidity ready to deliver: 24x average daily withdrawals  Actual:  Leverage: 1.7x Liquidity: 0.8x Sunday's withdrawals  Because, of course, when it rains, it pours.  We saw roughly $5b of withdrawals on Sunday--the largest by a huge margin. \n\n 7) And so I was off twice.  Which tells me a lot of things, both specifically and generally, that I was shit at.  And a third time, in not communicating enough.  I should have said more.  I'm sorry--I was slammed with things to do and didn't give updates to you all. \n\n 8) And so we are where we are.  Which sucks, and that's on me.  I'm sorry. \n\n 9) Anyway: right now, my #1 priority--by far--is doing right by users.  And I'm going to do everything I can to do that.  To take responsibility, and do what I can. \n\n 10) So, right now, we're spending the week doing everything we can to raise liquidity.  I can't make any promises about that.  But I'm going to try.  And give anything I have to if that will make it work. \n\n 11) There are a number of players who we are in talks with, LOIs, term sheets, etc.  We'll see how that ends up. \n\n 12) Every penny of that--and of the existing collateral--will go straight to users, unless or until we've done right by them.  After that, investors--old and new--and employees who have fought for what's right for their career, and who weren't responsible for any of the fuck ups. \n\n 13) Because at the end of the day, I was CEO, which means that \\*I\\* was responsible for making sure that things went well.  \\*I\\*, ultimately, should have been on top of everything.  I clearly failed in that.  I'm sorry. \n\n 14) So, what does this mean going forward?  I'm not sure--that depends on what happens over the next week.  But here are some things I know. \n\n 15) First, one way or another, Alameda Research is winding down trading.  They aren't doing any of the weird things that I see on Twitter--and nothing large at all.  And one way or another, soon they won't be trading on FTX anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHeres a link: [https:\/\/twitter.com\/SBF\\_FTX\/status\/1590709166515310593](https:\/\/twitter.com\/SBF_FTX\/status\/1590709166515310593)","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yrgcoz\/sbf_tweetstorm\/","author":"nocoast09","num_comments":70,"created_utc":1668089913000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"SBF Tweetstorm!","distinguished":null,"id":"yrgcoz","downs":null,"ups":null}

Alameda and FTX were intrinsically connected from day 1 and Alameda obviously participated in the FTX ICO.  \n\n\nBut what happened next was interesting...  \nAlameda then sent that \\*entire\\* balance to the address of the deployer (creator) of the FTT ERC20, which is controlled by someone at FTX.  \nIn other words, Alameda auto-vested $4.19 billion dollars worth of FTT just to send it immediately back to FTX.  \nHere's what might have happened:  \n\\- Alameda blew up in Q2 along with 3AC+ others.  \n\\- It ONLY survived because it was able to secure funding from FTX using as \"collateral\" the 172M FTT that was guaranteed to vest 4 months later.  \n\n\nOnce vested, all tokens were sent back as repayment.  \n\n\nRemember, the FTT ICO contract vests automatically.  \nHad FTX let Alameda implode in May, their collapse would have ensured the subsequent liquidation of all FTT tokens vested in September.  \nIt would have been terrible for FTX, so they had to find a way to avoid this scenario.  \nThe timing makes sense.\u00a0\n\nAlameda and FTX essentially put all chips on the table in Q2 and used that cash to bail others out.\u00a0  \nThis solidified FTXs image as a solvent and responsible institution, which helped FTT's price.  \nSo did SBFs political moves.  \n\n\nThe Alameda bailout likely put a dent on FTXs balance sheet to the point where it was no longer solvent.  \nThis would have been fine if the price of FTT didn't collapse and a bank run ensued  \nThis is why Alameda tried their best to protect FTT's price.  \nHere's where it gets crazier.  \nThere is a chance the folks from Binance knew about this arrangement between FTX and Alameda.  \nAn opportunity emerged.\u00a0  \nAs large holders of FTT, they could start deliberately tanking that market to force FTX to face a liquidity crunch.  \n\n\nCredit - Lucas Nuzzi","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yrgmjo\/ftx_might_have_provided_a_massive_bailout_for\/","author":"AffectionateMind26","num_comments":3,"created_utc":1668090484000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANALYSIS","title":"FTX might have provided a massive bailout for Alameda in Q2 which now came back to haunt them","distinguished":null,"id":"yrgmjo","downs":null,"ups":null}

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n\n## Why do we use it?\n\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yridfq\/shouldnt_exchanges_delist_ft\u1e6d_by_this_time_around\/","author":"HopefulManInChrist","num_comments":18,"created_utc":1668094123000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"Shouldn't exchanges delist FT\u1e6c by this time around already?","distinguished":null,"id":"yridfq","downs":null,"ups":null}

Nifty is also arguably the most artist-focused platform, which could help launch additional artists on Reddit's Collectible Avatar program.\n\n**Gemini Credit Card** \\- Card capabilities can enable incremental financial services for Reddit users.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":16,"selftext":"1) I'm sorry. That's the biggest thing. I fucked up, and should have done better.\n\n2) 2) I also should have been communicating more very recently. Transparently--my hands were tied during the duration of the possible Binance deal; I wasn't particularly allowed to say much publicly. But of course it's on me that we ended up there in the first place. \n\n3) 3) So here's an update on where things are. [THIS IS ALL ABOUT FTX INTERNATIONAL, THE NON-US EXCHANGE. FTX US USERS ARE FINE!] [TREAT ALL OF THESE NUMBERS AS ROUGH. THERE ARE APPROXIMATIONS HERE.] \n\n4) 4) FTX International currently has a total market value of assets\/collateral higher than client deposits (moves with prices!). But that's different from liquidity for delivery--as you can tell from the state of withdrawals. The liquidity varies widely, from very to very little. \n\n5) 5) The full story here is one I'm still fleshing out every detail of, but as a very high level, I fucked up twice. The first time, a poor internal labeling of bank-related accounts meant that I was substantially off on my sense of users' margin. I thought it was way lower. \n\n6) 6) My sense before: Leverage: 0x USD liquidity ready to deliver: 24x average daily withdrawals Actual: Leverage: 1.7x Liquidity: 0.8x Sunday's withdrawals Because, of course, when it rains, it pours. We saw roughly $5b of withdrawals on Sunday--the largest by a huge margin. \n\n7) 7) And so I was off twice. Which tells me a lot of things, both specifically and generally, that I was shit at. And a third time, in not communicating enough. I should have said more. I'm sorry--I was slammed with things to do and didn't give updates to you all. \n\n8) 8) And so we are where we are. Which sucks, and that's on me. I'm sorry. \n\n9) 9) Anyway: right now, my #1 priority--by far--is doing right by users. And I'm going to do everything I can to do that. To take responsibility, and do what I can. \n\n10) 10) So, right now, we're spending the week doing everything we can to raise liquidity. I can't make any promises about that. But I'm going to try. And give anything I have to if that will make it work. \n\n11) 11) There are a number of players who we are in talks with, LOIs, term sheets, etc. We'll see how that ends up. \n\n12) 12) Every penny of that--and of the existing collateral--will go straight to users, unless or until we've done right by them. After that, investors--old and new--and employees who have fought for what's right for their career, and who weren't responsible for any of the fuck ups. \n\n13) 13) Because at the end of the day, I was CEO, which means that *I* was responsible for making sure that things went well. *I*, ultimately, should have been on top of everything. I clearly failed in that. I'm sorry. \n\n14) 4) So, what does this mean going forward? I'm not sure--that depends on what happens over the next week. But here are some things I know. \n\n15) 15) First, one way or another, Alameda Research is winding down trading. They aren't doing any of the weird things that I see on Twitter--and nothing large at all. And one way or another, soon they won't be trading on FTX anymore. \n\n16) 16) Second, in any scenario in which FTX continues operating, its first priority will be radical transparency--transparency it probably always should have been giving. Giving as close to on-chain transparency as it can: so that people know *exactly* what is happening on it. \n\n17) 17) All of the stakeholders would have a hard look at FTX governance. I will not be around if I'm not wanted. All of the stakeholders--investors, regulators, users--would have a large part to play in how it would be run. Solely trust. \n\n18) 18) But all of that isn't what matters right now--what matters right now is trying to do right by customers. That's it. \n\n19) 19) A few other assorted comments: This was about FTX International. FTX US, the US based exchange that accepts Americans, was not financially impacted by this shitshow. It's 100% liquid. Every user could fully withdraw (modulo gas fees etc). Updates on its future coming. \n\n20) 20) At some point I might have more to say about a particular sparring partner, so to speak. But you know, glass houses. So for now, all I'll say is: well played; you won. \n\n21) 21) NOT ADVICE, OF ANY KIND, IN ANY WAY I WAS NOT VERY CAREFUL WITH MY WORDS HERE, AND DO NOT MEAN ANY OF THEM IN A TECHNICAL OR LEGAL SENSE; I MAY WELL HAVE NOT DESCRIBED THINGS RIGHT though I'm trying to be transparent.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":2,"selftext":"Its hard to believe that in just a few days its going to be one whole year since Bitcoin made its previous ATH of about $69.1k and since then we were in a brutal bear market with indeed a lot of highs and lows. But there were literally so many things that its very easy to lose track of, so here is a Rewind of One Year Bear Market, get ready for the rollercoaster:\n\n1. Complete Euphoria (Oct-Nov 2021)\n\nThe ride is going up now.  We are back in November 2021, we just got a Futures ETF approved by the SEC and had a glorious Uptober, even hitting a new ATH. But now we have been ranging at about $60k for days waiting to go into Price Discovery mode and obviously we can not forget the infamous PlanB predictions, predicting a $100k EOY Bitcoin, we all love those.\n\nNow we just got the Inflation data in and as its going higher and BTC is a inflation hedge obviously we rise to over $65k and there seem to be no stopping until the legendary $69.420k mark. But whats this? Resistance at $69k is so big we just got rejected.\n\n2. Denial (Dec 2021 - Feb 2021)\n\nNow we have been in a constant downtrend for a few months and even further had made a low at $34k and the infamous PlanB predictions were shattered as we closed about 50% below them at the end of the year. But suprisingly, many still were looking for arguments that we are not a bear market yet but just a bigger than usual bull market correction. Also many were talking about the infamous fifth Wave of the Elliot Wave Pattern yet to happen.\n\nA very high percentage of people actually still were bulls and thought that $34k is the bottom with ultimate fear. Well that did not end well\u2026\n\n3. End of the World and Bull Market (Feb - May 2022)\n\nNow we come to the time where fear was striking markets for the first time as a war was in the front between Ukraine and Russia and it did happen. BTC dived with stock markets to $34k again as many were expecting us to go way further as fear was high globally. But has Crypto ever done was people say? So instead BTC began what many thought would be the reversal with the last time we saw greed in crypto market. We had a rally to $45k and for many the bear market was once again done.\n\nBut even apart from all the prices BTC was also part of something beautiful that time, hundreds of millions of donations to Ukraine that they later even used to fund their military. That was (for me) one of the most wholesome things in crypto as crypto donations were apparently in a \u201chype\u201c.\n\n4. The End of the World, this time for real (May - July 2022)\n\nThis may be the most brutal time in crypto, ever. We jus had a fall from our long standing $34k support as we got rejected from $45k and the FED was now starting to hike rates, that mixed with a very high correlation of us to the stock markets caused a crash to $26k and then up to $30k in about a day.\n\nThat was also the period of the LUNA implosion as their so hyped-up algo stablecoin depegged and LUNA was down -50%. But still too many here thought UST would definitely peg again as if it is an unwritten rule. People bought the \u201cdip\u201c on LUNA and BTC was swinging around $30k in complete fear as the support was technically already broken.\n\nNow the Annihilation, BTC as thought could not hold up and the Do Kwon drama had been exposed now as analyst knew UST would not make it back up and it was all broken now. BTC plunges to $17k in a few days as fear has been the biggest ever with people straight up leaving. The \u201cdead\u201c of crypto was certain for everyone outside of the few still standing.\n\n5. Aftermath (July 2022 - Now)\n\nNow its basically all been crabbing and crabbing with crypto being the most flat it has been since years. Hopes for a bear market rally come and go but the FED is keeping us down, a lot of false hopes. Just as the anniversary now approached we made another leg down in one of the most intense weeks ever in Crypto with the FTX-Binance drama unfolding and taking a ton of twists and turns, ultimately leaving crypto even more vulnerable.\n\nConclusion:\n\nNow how has been the journey? Some scenarios and the overall development may be very similar to something we know:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Market Psychology chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/huo6ostax5z91.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31b57891e9f73626cfbe2484d181e223271b7479)\n\nThis graph has been often memed about but I think it still showed our situation pretty well. We had Denial, we had anger and we definitively had depression. Where are we now? Who knows, but thats also not important as I think people like us who went through this one year of fear and ultimate fear and more fear, can surely survive longer.\n\nIf we have now come this far it would be silly to just turn around. Maybe we have a few months left in this bear or perhaps a few years but the right conviction and patience will get you past it just as it helped you moving until now.\n\nGo out, touch grass, go on a hike. You were here until now and you surely will be here until tomorrow.

Bare mind most of these short meme-like lines were produced by people who had hands made of far stronger materials than yours, the crypto investor is truly born within bear cycles, surviving them is what separates the veteran from the noob, and it's not really wise to discard people who have been doing what you're triying to do before you even knew it was a thing in the first place.\n\nHere I'll do a quick recap of some of these advice one-liners you'll find when navigating the crypto markets, and why they make a whole lot of sense and shouldn't be disregarded.\n\n# HODL\n\nThe easiest one to explain by far.\n\nTo HODL just means to hold on to your assets instead of actively trading. If it sounds effortless to you it's because it actually is (Although maybe not so much psychologically), you basically sit tight and do absolutely nothing.\n\n\"But the market is crashing!\" you say, yeah, we know it is because we also look at charts, silly, but has anything changed fundamentally with your investment? Did you just invest because of price and not because you determined that this project you're into was fundamentally sound?  Well, that was your first mistake. There's a million outside forces that will manipulate prices either way, but at the core, projects that have a solid fundamental base will thrive, no matter the market. If you picked tickers that made actual sense why would you sell when you're already 70-80% down on it? Is recouping a meager 20% of your principal worth it? Everyone should expect 90% moves going into the crypto market, this is not the stock market, people don't jizz their pants for a 2% move, which brings me to the next one-liner...\n\n# Only invest what you're willing to lose\n\nDon't take a loan over the family barn to invest in crypto...that's just wrong. You shouldn't be playing with money you know you're gonna need. Makes no sense to gamble tomorrow's lunch money on the shitcoin lottery, *unless you're triying to lose weight of course*.\n\nYour investment budget should always be 100% play-money, you might get more of this play-money by living frugally, but being forced to live frugally because you fucked up is dumb as fuck, people! How can you NOT be emotionally invested in your positions if it's perfomance can make or break you? Don't expose yourself like that, determine your budget and don't go above it, it'll help you sleep better at night and avoid getting cold sweats every time you press \"BUY\".\n\n# Not your keys, not your tokens\n\nFTX. Celcius. Voyager. Quadriga CX.

People got into FTX because they wanted futures, had they used GMX or GNS none of this SBF bullshit would have happened.\n\nBuy your crypto with your credit card if you must (Mt.Pelerin, Transak, MoonPay), but if you're like me you're gonna wanna look at P2P services like Agora's desk, Localmonero, Localbitcoins, Robosats, etc. If you're unsure about non-custodial wallets for your blockchain of choice googling does the trick, which once again, brings me to the next one-liner...\n\n# DYOR or DIE\n\nDo your fucking research already. Don't follow Crypto Gurus on social media, don't buy shit because some random asshole said so on Youtube, don't get into a project even if your dad and mom sit down and beg you to do it!!!! **always**, and i do mean **ALWAYS** do your own research. Read whitepapers, get accustomed to how they're written. Understand the tokenomic model of the projects you like, is it sustainable? Are there tokens to be vested from VC rounds? When? Is the circulating supply fragmented enough or is there a single wallet controlling the majority of the tokens?\n\nIf you didn't do proper DD (Due Dilligence^(tm)) you can't ever be sure about what you invested into, how is anyone meant to form conviction around that? Of course you're gonna paper-hand as soon at the chart moves!\n\nSo yeah peeps, that's about all I have to say, I just got cringed out by how many posts ala \"CRYPTO IS A PONZI\", \"WE'RE GOING TO 0\" have surfaced now that we've put in a lower low, and how often they come from people with three seconds into the market or less, equating CEXes with blockchain technology and blaming the tech for the greed of a few CEOs. Of course these people wouldn't be posting that if prices where going up, we only care about morals when we're  the ones getting fucked, apparently.\n\nSo to finish my TED talk, allow me to quote the one and only Notorious B.I.G. :\n\n*Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up*\n\n*If not, 24 bears on the wake up*\n\n*Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up*\n\n*care-taker did your make up*","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yrn6az\/our_meme_oneliners_exist_for_a_reason_stop\/","author":"DMugre","num_comments":17,"created_utc":1668103950000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ADVICE","title":"Our \"meme\" one-liners exist for a reason, stop thinking you're over that if you're a newbie","distinguished":null,"id":"yrn6az","downs":null,"ups":null}

There's always gonna be better days than other, and things may eventually turn out brighter than you expect.\n\nAnd it's OK that you took a risk.\n\nIf you never take risks in your life, you're never going to do anything or go anywhere. It's normal to have to take risks. And often they come at a cost.\n\nThere's nothing impressive about having a million dollars in your bank account.\n\nBut there is something incredibly impressive about being able to pick yourself back up after a bad loss, and being able to somehow muster strength out of nowhere to get back on your feet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# You can't control the market, and can't change the past.\n\nMuch less know what the market will do next.

Of all the bills that have been introduced and talked about the furthest one along is S. 4760 the \"Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act of 2022\". Since I work in the House of Representatives I reached out to colleagues that work on the Senate side to see what the temperature was like since their legislation and possible votes before the end of the year. What I have heard back since though was not what I had expected to hear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGiven the collapse of FTX and the rumored $8 billion hole in their balance sheet, I assumed that the Senate would move quickly to try and pass this legislation to show the American people look we are at least trying to do something. The issue though is that SBF was the biggest and most vocal supporter of the legislation and because of that there are concerns and uncertainty about the legislation. Members do not want to get the look of they are siding with him or really associated with him so his support is actually coming back around to hurt the legislation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt will be interesting to see how everything is handled\/addressed with lawmakers back in Washington, D.C. next week. Voting is sure to be a huge talking point with some racing possibly taking into early next week to decide and then there is the Senate runoff race in early December. This could lead to legislation being put on ice for now while other tasks are accomplished like funding the government which comes up again in December.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yrnn3n\/what_happens_to_s_4760_now\/","author":"Status_Floor1746","num_comments":5,"created_utc":1668105047000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"OPINION","title":"What Happens to S. 4760 Now?","distinguished":null,"id":"yrnn3n","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":8,"selftext":"I see lots of people upvoting comments insinuating that if Alameda purchased $30bn of USDT then they'd still be solvent. This is factually incorrect. They could have purchased $30bn USDT and converted into other tokens or staked it. In fact, if that statistic is true, they almost certainly aren't sitting on $30bn of liquid stables or they wouldn't be in their current predicament.\n\nAlso, if Tether only has 50% of its reserves in liquid cash equivalents they can continue to defend the peg barring a mass liquidation event. If they have $50bn in cash equivalents and the remainder in illiquid securities and tokens, they will continue to honor redemptions\/maintain the peg until liquidity dries up and they can no longer sell cash equivalents to purchase USDT on the open market\/honor 1:1 USD:USDT redemptions.\n\nI have no insight into Tether's balance sheet, however I do find it hard to believe, IF TRUE, that Alameda was able to fund creation of $30bn of Tether at 1:1 USDT:USD. Some say that this is due to Alameda selling other assets over time to fund USDT creation and trade it back into the ecosystem. This makes no sense, as there's a much higher frictional cost and liquidity is lower if one wants to convert assets to USD and then fund USDT creation. There's no reason they wouldn't keep the money in the ecosystem and trade crypto assets directly for USDT in the open market.\n\nIf the revelation of them funding $30bn USDT is true, it's hard to imagine a way in which they could come up with such a liquid amount of cash to finance these creations given USDT is backed 1:1. And while many here like to overlook it, it should be a MASSIVE red flag that over five years into the Tether drama, they still haven't hired a reputable auditor to reassure everyone in the space. Where there's smoke, there's generally fire.\n\nThat being said, people who believe the peg is fraudulent are way ahead of themselves in thinking the FTX debacle will lead to a depeg, barring some revelation that causes panic and mass liquidation\/redemption of USDT. Even 50% of their assets being cash equivalents could keep the plates spinning for a long time, especially given the high demand for stablecoins in the current crypto environment.\n\nI'll probably be called a FUDer but I have no horse in this race; I have zero money and crypto and simply enjoy watching the space.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":2,"selftext":"A lot of FUD is hitting the front page right now with regard to FTX, SBF, CZ, Binance balance sheets, Michael Saylor doubling down on his MSTR Bitcoin aquisitions and none of it is actually relevant. The crypto market, at this point, is becoming its own beast. Certain movements are only natural, like waves, in an ocean. That actually sounds a little wooly, but there's some truth to it. I don't mean to say that technical analysis is true either but the market does rhyme.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe predictable thing in the market is that it will react explosively to bad news, particularly when the sentiment is already depressed (e.g. on a downturn) and it needs a lot of time to consolidate regardless of timing of events. In this case the collapse of FTX was the trigger. If this had not happened, perhaps the CPI would have influenced this. If not that, perhaps another exchange failing, some more China FUD and if not that then something else. What I'm saying is, in a bear market, there is always something -that would otherwise be irrelevant- influencing the crypto space in an explosive negative way. Consolidation takes time, things will bounce to previous levels before it can slow down or enough liquidity has been built for it to move again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe way I see things evolve, and I'd like to refer to the zooming out method, is by expecting a similar retracement to what we have seen happen before in 2018 and in 2014. It's actually the third time we're seeing this happen and I'm putting my faith - because that's essentially what it is - in expecting that it will sort of behave the same way as before. In short, I expect it to keep slowly bleeding as it did and on days like today I expect it to deflate to fast you can't really react to the moment. Days like today are days in which we must be patient and tolerate the pain. Please see the three links below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarketcap collapse 2013-2015 : [https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/oOZqvmG.jpg](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/oOZqvmG.jpg)\n\nMarketcap collapse 2018-2019 : [https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Cjpov0o.jpg](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Cjpov0o.jpg)\n\nMarketcap collapse 2021-current : [https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/rYVwzuF.jpg](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/rYVwzuF.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can see from the images above, the first two times the market deflated it retraced by approximately 87%. For the first deflation, the total marketcap of the crypto space went from $25.218m to $3.468m. The low comes in around 13.75% of the high. The second deflation of crypto market cap went from $852.884m to $102.289m. This comes in around 11.97% of the high. This is pretty much the theory. I expect the current market to deflate at a similar rate.\n\nOur current high was $3.080.321m. I'm well aware that no serious analysis was ever done on only 2 datapoints but since we have very little else to go on it's no stretch of the imagination that the low for this cycle could come in at a similar percentage, which presents us with a low of $368.770m. That's quite a ways down from this point onward. To put that into perspective, according to this assumption, Bitcoin has a potential low of around $11k. I should mention, I did not take into account Bitcoin market dominance, though I doubt it really matters very much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just wanted to make this post because this is one way I'm trying to manage expectations for myself. It doesn't influence the way I average my way down nor does it motivate me to save up money and invest later; in other words, I don'ttry to time the market. I've learned my lessons back in 2017 when I was trying to do that and I didn't manage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading you guys. Hope you keep perspective.\n\nCheers!","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yrqe55\/a_perspective_on_marketcap_deflation\/","author":"il_duomino","num_comments":10,"created_utc":1668110958000,"edited":1668111347000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANALYSIS","title":"A perspective on marketcap deflation","distinguished":null,"id":"yrqe55","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":229,"selftext":"The FTX debacle has just cost countless users a ton of money and to sump it up probably billions of dollars of customers deposits were just misused by FTX with no way to pay them all back if needed. That's even something SBF acknowledged in his poorly written apology on Twitter. They clearly never had the capacity to pay out all assets, so it was truly the case of not your keys not your crypto.\n\nBut now out of all that mess we have got one good improvement as we usually get from every crisis. Out of crisis follows change. And now the big change is to audit your reserves and actually make the user aware that there is enough assets around to pay the user out at any time.\n\nHere is a list of some big exchanges doing that:\n\n1. Binance, directly announced it and have said to conclude a complete POR by a few weeks. (talks of just fractional reserves are emerging but also got logically debunked so far) \n\n2. Crypto.com just joined too for a POR, going to be interesting here as CRO was seen in some troubles lately.\n\n3. OKX, OKX has also said to give $1b to FTX for their fundraising soon.\n\nLast but not least at all, Kraken has already doing it for a while now.\n\nSo obviously Proof-of-reserve has become a big concept to gain trust from the user. But how can we be sure that it's 100% true? Exchanges should in the best case have a regular audit done by third-parties. That's my opinion.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yrss1l\/there_is_actually_one_good_thing_we_got_out_of\/","author":"partymsl","num_comments":68,"created_utc":1668116856000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"There is actually one good thing we got out of this crash: Other centralized Exchanges rushing for proof-of-reserves to gain trust.","distinguished":null,"id":"yrss1l","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":4,"selftext":"For starters, my thoughts are for those traders and account holders of FTX whose funds are frozen due to their exchange's insolvency, and the potential legal mess that would follow going forward. As always, we not only should be reminded of the phrase: \"Not your keys, not your crypto.\", but take no chances by moving our assets **off** of exchanges, no matter whether that exchange you choose to park your digital assets is financially healthy today.\n\nAs the title suggests, regulation of any industry, both securities and commodities alike is not an absolute solution, but it's a necessary one. Without question, FTX's market valuation proves that it is not enough to let any financial entity self-police itself by maintaining compliance when there is little to no independent agency to oversee the entire company. Worse, any regulatory policy that isn't clear gives permission for several exchanges to determine how they should meet compliance with the market they do business in. In the case of Sam-Bankman Fried, as well as FTX, this perspective couldn't be more alarming when it comes to this nascent market.\n\nConsider Peregrine Financial Group, a lesser-known commodities futures-trading firm that was bankrupt back exactly 10 years ago, which was ran by its now-convicted CEO: Russell Wasendorf, Sr. Unlike SBF, whom he had lobbied U.S. lawmakers to consider policy ideas for the industry (And now, he is considered to be in legal trouble with them too), Russell Wassendorf, Sr. oversaw the company during its nearly two-decade existence until 2012 -- a company that brought futures trading to individual traders through its online platform. But it went into legal trouble over confirmed allegations that his firm mishandled client funds, which brought attention to CFTC and the FBI, and ultimately resulted in both the company's insolvency and his overall demise in [federal prison](https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/usao-ndia\/pr\/peregrine-financial-group-ceo-sentenced-50-years-fraud-embezzlement-and-lying).\n\nAt this point, the situation is certainly escalating to how FTX will meet its fate at the end of the day. However, any regulatory effort shouldn't be ignored on the fact that without a sound regulatory framework in various parts of the global economy when it comes to crypto exchanges, the crypto market, as we know it today, will not gain its own legitimacy for years to come.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yruc5q\/ftx_liquidity_crisis_of_2022_regulation_in_the\/","author":"[deleted]","num_comments":13,"created_utc":1668120821000,"edited":1668131217000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"OPINION","title":"FTX Liquidity Crisis of 2022: Regulation in the Cryptosphere is coming one way or another.

There were also rumours that SBF was involved in the deal which was later denied by him. In my opinion, the fact that SBF could easily reach this deal with Sun is proof they had some sort of prior business dealings. \n\nAn initial investment of $13,000,000 of assets will be used to support and back these withdrawals. Basically, they are starting with allowing $13M of funds to be withdrawn through Sun-related tokens. There will be more funds added that are determined on a weekly basis and will be injected at 14:00UTC depending on such factors such as withdrawal demand and funding capacity. SBF may be trash but this facility is better than losing everything.\n\nNow an issue is that we will see others who buy these Sun-related tokens as they expect a pump and capitalize on desperate FTX bagholders who will look to buy these tokens as it is seemingly their only way out. And as with all pumps lacking any real foundation we will see a dump when non-FTX \"investors\" inevitably sell after taking advantage of the situation and those who *do* manage to withdraw immediately dump after doing so. This dump will definitely occur in Sun-related tokens and might quite possibly cause another sell-off across the entire market as there is an estimated 9 Billion funds left on FTX that WILL be liquidated from these Sun-tokens to other coins and\/or USD.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yrujdr\/expect_a_pump_and_dump_as_sbf_and_justin_sun\/","author":"OneThatNoseOne","num_comments":21,"created_utc":1668121339000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANALYSIS","title":"Expect a pump and dump as SBF and Justin Sun reached an agreement allows withdrawals from FTX using Sun-related tokens","distinguished":null,"id":"yrujdr","downs":null,"ups":null}

Gox handled 70% of all bitcoin transactions in 2014. In the same year, it went bankrupt.\n\nLuna was in the top 10 cryptocurrencies during the last bull run. A few months after, its value went from $115 to $0.00009.\n\nRecently, FTX, the ~~second~~ fifth biggest exchange today, has been found to be insolvent and is currently on the verge of going bankrupt.\n\nIn all these events, thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people, were fucked over with no recourse in sight. There's no security in numbers in the crypto space.\n\nDuring the bull run, you'll hear people say how a project is good if it has a solid community behind it. But the harsh reality is a solid community wouldn't be able to do jack-shit for you when shit hits the fan.\n\nThe key takeaway is, when you invest in crypto (read as gamble), be prepared to take responsibility for your shit.\n\nBe prepared to protect your own coins in your own wallet. CZ won't keep your crypto safe, and neither will Kraken. You absolutely have no recourse when a CEX loses your coins, just look at what happened to the Mt. Gox customers 8 years after the company's collapse, and they still can't take back their coins.\n\nBe prepared to make YOUR OWN financial decisions. Don't listen to those influencers or sometimes even echo chambers that tell you to HODL-- you'll most likely be fucked if you do. Despite the popular advice, DCAing and HODLing are more nuanced than some people make them out to be; sometimes, selling all your coins at a loss may be a better move.\n\nLastly, never trust crypto CEOs. When they tell you everything's okay, the project is most likely fucked. If they tell you they're not on the run, they're absolutely running away for their lives. If they tell you they're sorry, they are not; it's just their PR speaking.\n\nThese lessons may all sound harsh and unreasonable but it is the sad reality. It is the price we need to pay for decentralization.\n\nEdit: FTX was not the second biggest exchange.

The token SOL has since grown to become the a top-15 most-valued cryptocurrency. I don't think I need to delve into the problems of Solana. And SBF holds almost 10%% of of the circulating supply. It seems people put two and two together  with the SBF\/FTX mess and sold with SOL falling 50% since issues started Sunday.\n\nAlameda Research has received that **largest issuance** share of USDT tokens of **any institution**. This amounts to 37% of Tether issuance at the end of 2021. This has been linked to potential fraud with FTX which is definitely not past Tether to do. I made a [previous post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ypntal\/sbfs_alameda_deep_dealings_with_tether_and\/) of FTX alleged market manipulation likely using this USDT. SBF had also [revealed plans](https:\/\/www.investing.com\/news\/cryptocurrency-news\/sam-bankmanfried-reveals-ftx-stablecoin-plans-2924280) for FTX to create their own stablecoin.\n\nRegarding FTT Tokens, Alameda actually owns $6.1 Billion of FTT as assets. This value is actually almost TWICE AS LARGE as the *circulating supply.* That is to say, Alameda owns 170% of the circulating supply. This lends strong credence to the possibility that SBF has FTX issues FTT tokens basically freely to Alameda which they borrow against to create \"infinite money\". I [made a previous post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yoof8g\/sbf_and_alameda_research_allegedly_using_ftx_in\/) explaining their alleged infinite money scheme, and it would definitely explain why SBF's empire evaporated overnight if it was all artificial.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":23,"selftext":"The entire crypto industry has now moved toward proof of reserves following the recent platform collapse. Kraken had been providing and pioneering regular asset audits since 2014 and audited proof of reserves since early this years. Crypto.com and Binance have now followed suit, committing to proof of reserves. Many other major industry [players are now scrambling](https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2022\/11\/09\/crypto-exchanges-scramble-to-compile-proof-of-reserves-as-ftx-contagion-grips-markets\/) to do the same including Gate.io, Poloniex, Bitget, Huobi, Deribit and Bybit. OKX and Kucoin [have claimed](https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/okx-kucoin-say-proof-of-reserves-will-be-ready-in-a-month) to have these proof ready in a month. This bring our total number of potential audited exchanges to 11. However, there are several problems.\n\n1. What happens if any of these exchanges fail to provide reserves as they promised?\n\nBasically, if any of these exchanges are secretly insolvent or simply illiquid to the point of being unable to provide reserves we are look at a possible similar situation as what happened recently. This can happen with any *one or more* of any of these exchanges that can exacerbate the problem. Further, an exodus and mass withdrawal from one platform can cause panics on *other* platforms that can lead to actual insolvency on other platforms.\n\n2. What happens to the other exchanges other than above that fail to reserves at all?\n\nAgain, we are looking at a very probably exodus from these exchanges since it would be very fishy for them not being able to provide such proofs. There is also the possibility that the exchanges may simply take too long to gather resources to release their proofs which may lead to users to panic and withdraw whether or not the exchanges do have the reserves or not. \n\n3. Recent events and possible future events can simply dishearten investors.\n\nWe are already in a bear market, in an economy in shambles in almost any area you look. Investors have been taking losses since the start of the years and are set to take even more for the bare minimum of 1.5 years until the economy recovers. This could simply be a point of capitulation for many investors who either either no longer willing or can no longer afford to bear the losses. Some may even simply choose to back out and wait until regulation takes over, while others who were set to invest may choose to delay and do the same.\n\n4. Many will choose to opt for cold storage\n\nMany of us now truly see that we can never fully trust Cefi and choose to move funds to a hardware wallet or simply off-exchanges. This likely means much less trading and price movement that will further entrench the already cold crypto winter.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ys8bam\/we_must_be_realistic_and_prepared_for_another\/","author":"OneThatNoseOne","num_comments":34,"created_utc":1668167762000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ADVICE","title":"We Must Be Realistic And Prepared For Another Platform Mass Exodus, Potential Crash And Sell-off","distinguished":null,"id":"ys8bam","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":267,"selftext":"Yesterday, FTX announced a [deal with Justin Sun](https:\/\/help.ftx.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/10739365280276-FTX-Announcement-Regarding-the-Tron-Credit-Facility) platform\/DAO to allow users to withdraw but only through one of the many Sun-owned coins like BTT, SUN, JST which now also includes the Huobi token HT, as Sun now owns some stake in the company that may be as much as 100% of the company as the Huobi founder was set to sell all of his stake.  SBF was also rumoured to be involved in the Huobi deal, which is lent further credence by how quickly this SBF-Sun deal for FTX was put together.\n\nThe credit facility began yesterday with $13 Million dollars to be shared in asset value across all these tokens as liquidity that can be bought by users who may then withdraw. Further injections of cash are to every week. Now we know that FTX owes around $8 Billion dollars. Obviously, there will be limited supply of tokens with the demand WAY above supply. Look as what has been happening with these tokens over the past week and then yesterday since the credit announcement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dqhz7siy9bz91.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f13605766a41e48834f368ba51944e50aab72af\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0e97fviy9bz91.png?width=950&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=293fa3e7f0a9d0e4beb0b66687536ffa4552696a\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/tect3viy9bz91.png?width=954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96c318e272b0b7e2e7d58eb8885593f988364e5c\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7swez0jy9bz91.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df315c7c6972ac3cf529c3e36d1a0b937425b48c\n\nAnd think about this. Justin Sun can pump his tokens into FTX, sell it to desperate users, gain HUGE markups on the price and of course his buddy SBF would allow HIM to withdraw *his* profits. And they do it all again next week as the agreement said. This is all very calculated, make no mistake. Justin knows there is huge demand and is **purposefully** limiting supply thus blowing the price skyward. This is even clearer as the agreement disables any user deposits of any of Sun's tokens, so that Sun is the only one allowed to pump these tokens into FTX per the agreement and be the sole benefactor of making this absolute killing on profits at bagholders expense.\n\nThese tokens have been selling for as much as **4600%** markups over the market price. And this is not just isolated cases, as many *millions* of tokens have been sold to unfortunate users at these prices. Prices more recently have settle down to about **575%** above market but this is obviously still insane. Also, Sun can make his tokens seem like all the rage all this huge artificial volume in his tokens. Parasites just feeding on near-corpses.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ys98ze\/justin_sun_and_sbf_are_allegedly_absolutely\/","author":"OneThatNoseOne","num_comments":87,"created_utc":1668170240000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANALYSIS","title":"Justin Sun and SBF Are (Allegedly) Absolutely Ripping Off FTX Users Desperate To Withdraw","distinguished":null,"id":"ys98ze","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":5,"selftext":"Bear with me a little bit here (pun intended). I know crypto is in a world of pain and am very aware that at the moment noone is even daring to dream of a bear market bottom (thanks Sam!). But I have some data that I thought would be interesting to present here. This data can be used as a tentative argument for that the bottom should come this winter.\n\nI have absolutely no idea whether this will come to fruition. Several bottom indicators already failed given the new low. Nevertheless, I look forward to your thoughts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1)  \"Time in the market\": Months from cycle high to bear market low**\n\nThe past two cycles, it took 14 or 12 months to get from the cycle high until the bear market low. We are currently 12 months away from the all time high in 2021.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* 2013 high - 2015 bear low: **14 months**\n* 2017 high - 2018 bear low: **12 months**\n* 2021 high - now: **12 months**\n\nThese three periods are highlighted in the chart below.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mry86hgzvbz91.png?width=1285&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8363a2c69b418f2d964a88168e6e451dd3a53da6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2) \"Time in the market\": Time from bear market low UNTIL next halving**\n\nThe past two cycles, the cycle bear market low until the halving lasted 18 or 17 months. Currently, we are 16 months away from the estimated next halving. So we already passed it by a little.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* 2015 bear low to 2016 halving: **18 months**\n* 2018 bear low to 2020 halving: **17 months**\n* current low to estimated tine of 2024 halving: **16 months**\n\nThese three periods are highlighted in the chart below.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/khjz1oljxbz91.png?width=1283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db31c6a862966bbc4ff354bbc92cf0288b807e90\n\n**So, from purely a time perspective, if history were to repeat, we should bottom soon.** Note that based on percentage drawdown from the cycle high until the bear low in the past, we should fall more from here:\n\n* 2013 high - 2015 bear low: **-87%**\n* 2017 high - 2018 bear low: **-84%**\n* 2021 high - current low: **-77%**\n\nAnd unfortunately, the leading people in this space and doing everything to their ability to ensure that we drop more. Obligatory fuck Sam Bankman-Fried here. Based on prior bears we should bit $10k.\n\n**Is there** ***some*** **confluence for this happening?** Well, yes, but you are not going to like it. First, our friendly Wyckoff chart is back (lol)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7yzihdf20cz91.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39ad230aab6cce2cc07ce8851911f25a546305f8\n\nBut for this to have any chance the bounce yesterday should be the spring or we should see it in the near future. Difficult to imagine now.\n\nIronically enough, if we look at the Wall Street Cheat Seet and assume that June-October was the anger phase, setting a new low during the depression phase makes sense. Then we should bounce now and crab for a while, similar to the period before this drop.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wnyhifvmybz91.png?width=1030&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98286ea6b9a6f6750b7f1ca3feca6629656c9ba3\n\nAgain, just data and the sample size is small. Still, worth noting in my view.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":0,"selftext":"I am just a guy typing a post on reddit, sharing my thoughts.   I like to ask questions and put the pieces together of history and current events.   It's important to anticipate where this crypto market is headed now more than ever... the implications are totalitarian or a free market.   I am leaving a lot of ideas out because I will go to work soon.   So.... \n\nThis whole FTX issue took us all by suprise.   You could argue that the Twitter battle was the canary in the coal mines for what was to happen... but the fall of ftx happened so quick.   Nothing happens by accident, especially when you factor 9+ digits of capital.   Why did this happen?   \n\nHow did ftx rise so quickly?   Ftx is one of the more regulated exchanges in the US.  I have been in crypto since 2015 and had not heard of ftx until 2020.  Ftx seemingly came out of nowhere and sbf was crowned the \"king of crypto\".  The timing of ftx's growth came during gary gensler's power trip. They, ftx and sbf, had to pass many checks and balances to get the branding and recognition they developed.  So it has to be assumed ftx went through the regulation necessary to grow more.  \n\nHow did regulators miss the glaring hole in the ftt tokens?   With this new level of prestige and building a household name in crypto, sbf got more and more involved with politics and regulations.   We know now that there is some shady business going on between Alameda and ftx.  Now there is news about sbf selling customer assets to prop up Alameda.    They HAD to pass checks and balances to get the branding and recognition they developed.    This leaves me with 2 questions.  1) are regulators incompetent and miss something with ftx?   Or   2) did they know there was an issue and allow ftx to burn the crypto market?   Either way, ftx was supposed to fail.   \n\nWho would let ftx fail?   The crypto community all believe that crypto will be tool used for finance in the future, and so do the world leaders... they are not that stupid.   How do world leaders, central bankers, and governments ensure THEIR blockchain becomes the one primarily used by the people?   Easy.   Give the populace faith in an exchange, create instability in the market creating fear and anger,  then provide the solution to the problem..... a CBDC.  *suited grin from ear to ear.   \n\nSo I think this whole ftx issue is a distraction for something deeper.   Again.... how does something SO regulated fall?

For example Sun is accused of having copied the white paper of another coin.  He announced fake partnerships and fake prize giveaways too. And he apparently sold a lot of his shares in TRON to buy ETH instead.\n\nSince then TRON has been holding up okay but Sun has been in the headlines a few times, like when he reportedly took over Huobi or at least became an executive advisor, leading to the exit of both the CEO and CFO. \n\nAnd finally as we all know he put himself in the spotlight in the FTX collapse by offering to help, but some pointed out here that his \u201chelp\u201d only seem to have been to himself by putting money in his own pockets. This post outlines the shadiness of this \u201chelp\u201d provided by TRX.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yrr630\/sam_bankmanfried_mightve_just_committed_another\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n\nJust a reminder than TRON has the third DeFi TVL. I looked for a while but I can\u2019t find a post or article I read a few months ago about how most tokens on the chain are puns based on Sun and there were some accusations of Sun artificially pumping that TVL. \n\nSo if TRON was to collapse due to a USDD depeg or because of Justin Sun\u2019s shady activities, the crypto world would face another nightmare. Also because there is now more USDT traded on the TRON chain than on the Ethereum chain. And I for one would prefer for USDT to stay out of big collapse events right now.\n\n\nEdit: as some pointed out, of course get your own wallet to reduce exposure to Sun\u2019s scams, a cold one preferably. And avoid buying shitcoins. But even if you only buy BTC and put it on a hardware wallet it won\u2019t stop the price dumping if a top 20 crypto collapsed because of its shady founder.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ysf3dg\/after_do_kwon_and_sbf_justin_sun_and_trx_might_be\/","author":"MaeronTargaryen","num_comments":48,"created_utc":1668183621000,"edited":1668184611000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"After Do Kwon and SBF, Justin Sun (and TRX) might be the next one to watch out for","distinguished":null,"id":"ysf3dg","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":8,"selftext":"It's really just a short note today. A short note but a very broad and deep lesson. \n\nIt's no accident that every major bankruptcy and liquidation we've seen this year, has caused prices to crash with it. It's not just finicky investors and day traders dumping on the news (although that is a component as well). It's because these companies represent leverage, and quite often: fraud and ponzinomics. These were large factors in forming the double bubble of 2021.\n\nThe failure of these companies is tantamount to the unwinding of the leverage that pumped crypto markets well beyond organic\/sustainable prices. However, I don't want anyone to think I'm just hating on crypto. This kind of thing is a near certainty when given the extremely loose monetary policies of central banks, particularly in 2020, and continuing through 2021. \n\nWith FTX, we should be getting somewhat close to the major capitulation needed to finally wash out that leverage, and go back to more of a steady state, more organically priced market. At the same time, even a snowball that's reached the bottom of the mountain, still has momentum, and will keep rolling. \n\nAnd keep in mind, that the vast majority of coins are going to continue bleeding out for some time, even as a few main platforms with real usage and adoption are bottoming. The #1 and #2 marketcap coins of course. And the premier darknet coin is another solid contender for early bottoming. \n\nGenerally speaking, buying low cap and\/or speculative value coins is best done at the beginning of a bull market, not at the end of a bear market.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ysi7l1\/every_round_of_bankruptcies_and_liquidation_has\/","author":"bawdyanarchist","num_comments":28,"created_utc":1668190413000,"edited":1668190508000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"PERSPECTIVE","title":"Every Round of Bankruptcies and Liquidation has Led to Lower Lows","distinguished":null,"id":"ysi7l1","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":4,"selftext":"I don't make posts of my own on Reddit very often. I normally just make valueless witticisms in reply to *other people's* posts. Interspersed with overlong rants about why other people are Wrong on the Internet. Y'know, typical useless Redditor stuff.\n\nBut for once I think I might actually have something to contribute. I mean, not *much*. I'm not an expert on this. Not by any means. But I spent five minutes on Google and that's basically the same thing. So:\n\nA lot of people in response to the news of FTX bankruptcy seem to be think that means FTX can't pay its debts, it's going to be shut down, and that everything is going to be liquidated and the money divided between creditors. The secured creditors will be paid first, and unsecured creditors (like the users) probably won't get anything at all.\n\nLet me be clear: This may indeed end up being what happens. But it's not what this filing means. What you're describing here is what's called 'Chapter 7' bankruptcy. That's not what FTX is currently filing for. Currently, they are filing for Chapter *11* bankruptcy.\n\n# What's chapter 11?\n\nUnder Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the company continues operations, though they need to get permission from the court to do various things.  Their debts also don't get written off. Instead, the debt gets *restructured.*  The repayment terms get renegotiated so that the creditors can (hopefully) get their money (or most of it) back. Eventually.  I cannot emphasise the '**eventually**' part of that enough. The timelines on this tend to be loooooooong, because creditors would generally prefer to get repaid eventually than never to get repaid at all.\n\nThe company's assets are also reorganised.\n\nFirst the company gets a chance to suggest the terms of this reorganisation, and the new debt repayment plan, and they present it to the court. If the court agrees it's reasonably fair plan and that they might plausibly be able to pull it off, they go forward with that plan. If they can't find a plan the court agrees to, the creditors will get to propose their own plan.\n\nA lot of companies that try for Chapter 11 do end up failing. At which point we really *will* get a chapter 7 liquidation bankruptcy. But not all of them do. General Motors has been through chapter 11 before, for example, and it still exists. But I really don't want to give anyone false hope here: Enron did chapter 11 too and it is very much *not* still around.\n\n# So how are things looking for FTX so far?\n\nIt's too early to say, honestly. I found the full text of the FTX bankruptcy filing [here](https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/read-full-text-ftxs-bankruptcy-154000390.html). But most of you don't want to read that, so what does it say?\n\nWell, there are three parts I want to highlight. The first is the company's declaration about its liabilities and assets. The good news is that they gave the same answer for both! The *bad* news is that that answer is that their assets and liabilities are both 'between $10,000,001 and $50 billion'. That's... quite the range. They *could* have enough assets to theoretically pay back all their creditors. Or they could be short by up to thirty nine billion, nine hundred and ninety nine million, nine hundred and ninety nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine dollars.\n\nStill, ten billion plus in assets (at least on paper) is probably good news.\n\nSecond thing, they state in the bankruptcy filing that they estimate that 'funds will be available to unsecured creditors'. That doesn't mean they'll be able to pay everyone back *everything*, but the current legal position of the company seems to be that at least some of their customers will be getting some of their money back. Again, better than the worst of the reports suggested.\n\nAnd third thing, probably the most positive, is that John J Ray III has signed the filing declaring he has 'a reasonable belief that the information is true and correct'.\n\nWhy am I so happy about that? Is it because I think JJ is a wonderful, upright person who I would trust with my life? No. In fact, from what I understand he's allegedly kind of a snake. Buuuuuuut unlike SBF he didn't really have any skin in this game until now. As far as I can see, from the limited knowledge we have of this situation, he doesn't seem to have any obvious motive to commit bankruptcy fraud for SBF. He simply doesn't seem to benefit enough to make the risks involved worthwhile. SBF is broke now, he can't make a good enough offer. And if FTX is really worthless now, getting to be the CEO probably isn't a good enough reason either. Which means that what he's saying in the filing is at least a reasonable *enough* interpretation of the truth that the legal system is not going to call bullshit. Like, if they were counting debt owed by Alameda to FTX as an 'asset', that is the kind of thing that might not be considered entirely kosher. Or if they were counting FTT assets as being worth more than the $2-3 they were currently trading for.\n\n# TLDR that is somehow STILL too long\n\nI am not saying that everything is fine and your funds are safu. They are absolutely not (based on what we know so far). My guess is that if you still have funds in there you'll probably get *something* back, but I wouldn't bet on it and I *certainly* don't know when or how much. This bankruptcy filing seems, so far, to be in line with what we would expect if SBF was actually being honest in his tweets when he said they had more assets than liabilities and would be able to pay everyone back. That doesn't mean he actually *was*, but this doesn't prove he was lying.\n\nNone of this is financial or legal advice. I'm not a lawyer. And economics was part of my degree so you *certainly* shouldn't trust me to know anything about money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# An Edit\n\nSomething I want to add here because it's relevant to a lot of the first comments: I know even less about this than most of what's here, but as I understand it, getting through chapter 11 successfully might provide SBF with protection against some of criminal charges he might be facing. This means there is a chance he'll have cared more about making this work than bleeding everything he could from the company before stepping down. Though he may still have decided to take the money and hope the power of Rich would protect him.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ysms0p\/ftx_bankrupcy_chapter_11_vs_chapter_7\/","author":"Liwet_SJNC","num_comments":25,"created_utc":1668199981000,"edited":1668201778000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANALYSIS","title":"FTX bankrupcy: Chapter 11 vs Chapter 7.","distinguished":null,"id":"ysms0p","downs":null,"ups":null}

Bankruptcy is NOT a quick process and can be very confusing.\n\nHere is a SIMPLE breakdown of the process:\n\n* First, the debtor (FTX) files for bankruptcy and a bankruptcy estate is created. It's made up of all the assets of the debtor wherever located. The estate is managed by the veteran possession, which is really just the management of the company itself.  \n* Next, an official committee is appointed, usually made up of the seven largest unsecured creditors. Their purpose is to make sure the interests of all unsecured creditors are protected and to make sure there is no bankruptcy fraud.  \n* Then, creditors will have a chance to file a \"proof of claim\". This is a form that proves your debt. You attach evidence of some type of agreement between you and the debtor (FTX).\n* After that, it's a series of investigations. Investigating pre-petition actions of the debtor, and post-petition actions of the debtor. Seeing if there's any preference actions (anything that the debtor may have paid out within the last 90 days prior to filing the bankruptcy).\n* Next, FTX has to propose a chapter 11 plan. They have 120 days from filing to propose a plan, but it can be extended up to 300 days. The plan will then outline how creditors will be treated and how funds will be dealt with.\n* They will then prioritize who gets paid first. Typically, administrative, legal, and other expenses get top priority. Unsecured creditors are paid last.\n* Unsecured creditors get paid on pro rata. Typically, unsecured creditors with higher claims will get paid faster than those with smaller claims. If you claim $100,000 and someone else has a claim of $5,000, the person with the higher claim will be paid first.\n\n \n\n*Disclaimer: The information provided pertains to the United States.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":134,"selftext":"History doesn\u2019t repeat but it sure rhymes. This feels like a giant dejavu from the 2014 bear market. \n\nWhen MTGOX went down most people had believed that to be the end to bitcoin, crypto and the industry as a whole. \n\nThe fact that we are here 8 years later means crypto is alive and well, and it will succeed. Crypto in 2014 and before each year was inherently more riskier than at any point today. The space has grown incredibly since that time and with growth comes challenges. Reddit has its own NFT market now and moon coins to tip, vote and create entire eco systems. We are still early to this exciting future.\n\nBitcoin isn\u2019t the problem. The problem lies with centralization, the institutions, the humans running the exchanges we trust. \n\nJust this year alone we had collapses of Luna, Voyager, Celsius, FTX, BlockFi and many more. In each case they have misused customers funds, have been dishonest, deceitful, full of promises and nothing but lies. Did those projects have good intentions? Perhaps. However there is third party risks and most importantly human error.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest somewhere the house of dominos fell. It had to happen sooner or later. How many more people would have been hurt by these entities? Flushing out the swamp is the best thing that could of happened. This space needs time to heal. \n\nWhat can we learn? Well what has been posted many times and should continue to be - take your crypto off exchanges and move it to cold storage. You\u2019ll sleep better at night \n\nThis year will be known as the great purge in crypto. I believe it is healthy long term. I fell victim to the scam of Celsius. Many of us have been incredibly hurt by those projects we put our faith in. \n\nInevitably regulation will come and at this point that is a good thing. Most cryptos in itself are securities. The safest option arguably will always be Bitcoin first and ETH second. Long term you can recoup.\n\nKeep in mind after the whole MTGox fiascos - Bitcoin fell from $1100 to the lows of 200-300. Did bitcoin die? No. I remember the doom and gloom was just as bad as today. Most were absolutely defeated. Bitcoin is up still to 17k at the time of this post. Did people think they were \u201ctoo late\u201d yes many did. Could they be more wrong? Of course. People at bitcointalk were complaining about buying at $100+, and now people were buying it for $10 or even $1 and less. The same way in 2025, 2030 will be complaining about not buying in at the bear markets. We all have regrets in this space and wish we could have a time machine.\n\nI don\u2019t have a crystal ball. However bitcoin is trending up with time. Does it mean it will be smooth sailing? No. However those that stuck with it became rewarded. \n\nWe have to move on. We owe it to ourselves, family and community. I always regretted not staying in the bear markets. This is the time to rebuild. Set a plan, stay disciplined and have risk tolerance. I have been incredibly impacted like many of you. I should have known better. However back in the days we didn\u2019t have such an awesome community. We can all learn and grow together. I\u2019m always happy to share my story and experiences and would love to hear yours as well.\n\nYou will make it back, and come back stronger.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ysovuj\/2022_collapses_is_the_best_thing_to_happen_to\/","author":"SimplyShred","num_comments":148,"created_utc":1668204980000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"2022 collapses is the best thing to happen to crypto long term","distinguished":null,"id":"ysovuj","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":0,"selftext":"According to Elliot wave analyze, Bitcoin could finally have reached its final bottom.\nThe structure and fractal counts can thus be counted as complete.\nIn addition, there are some other aspects that suggest that this is the end of the accumulation phase and the bear market.\n\nEven before the whole FTX debacle, before you even knew anything about it in the last two months, it was to be expected that Bitcoin would start a new low. This could be seen in the corrective structure and trading volume.\nFTX was just the trigger (if FTX hadn't happened then there was probably another event that would have triggered the price slide).\nAnd no, you can never be 100% sure with analyzes. But you can use it to create probabilities that can help you buy and sell.\n\nAnother chart-technical reason: The trading volume had a peak again. High trading volume in certain wave sections indicates formation completion. High trading volume = possible bottom.\n\nYou can also look at the bitcoins on exchanges again.\nHere's a good rule \u201eof thumb\u201c:\n- If many bitcoins are held on exchanges -&gt; short signal (the coins are drawn on exchanges to sell them = pressure to sell increases).\n- If many bitcoins are fetched from exchanges -&gt; long signal (the coins are drawn on cold walls to keep them = selling pressure decreases).\n\nWhat you need to know now and what\u2019s the most important thing here: \nIf the pressure to sell decrease and the buying pressure increase, there are more buyer in the market and the price goes up. \nIf the opposite happens then of course the pressure to sell increase.\n(Supply and demand)\n\nOne can currently clearly see that on one of the largest platforms (cb pro - used by institutional organizations in the US) the stocks of Bitcoin are going down and are being moved to cold wallets.\n\nSo I am in good spirits that we have seen the low and we will finally see impulsive green structures now.\n\nSure, no one knows s. about f., but this is my technical analyze and maybe it helps someone of you. I\u2019m bullish now and I\u2019m rly happy that this long accumulation phase could be finished now.\n\nWhat can happen now?\n- So a lot of alts have developed a nicely countable 5-impulse structure after their current low.\nImpulsive structures (5 waves) must arise according to elliot waves in order to determine a trend direction.\nThese structures must now be confirmed in the next few days. Then we can say with an even higher probability that this was the final bottom. \nAs long as no corrective patterns are created here, it should work (except in the waves 2 and 4 they are always corrective). \n\nLet\u2019s see what happens now and dca is always the best way for reaching the personally goal and yeah, no one can time the market. \nStay healthy guys and no, it\u2019s not a financial advice. \nThese are just my 5 words but maybe they can help some of you! \n\nNice weekend for you guys!\n\n\nEDIT:\nWell it seems like a lot of you guys where triggered by that.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":10,"selftext":"There is a scramble to make use of the newfound sunlight that filters down to the ground. Similarly, the fall of FTX has created a number of interesting opportunities for crypto investors.\n\nI will start by saying that, despite the absolutely horrific levels of general sentiment, and the nothing short of tragic loss of billions in user funds, what happened with FTX will be seen, over the long term, as a good thing.  SBF\u2019s reputation not only as a grifter, but an actively hostile figure who was trying to use regulation to hobble the entire space, has come to light before any further damage could be done.\n\nThere are a range of industry-shaking black swan events.  The worst would be an actual failure of code at the protocol level. Bitcoin beginning to double spend, SHA-256 encryption getting hacked, new ETH being printed infinitely. These are the horror events that would really crater the entire space for an indefinite period.\n\nAt the other end, you have the black swan that we have experienced in the last week. A pyramid of overleveraged CeFi institutions collapsing like the hollow house of cards that they were, and destroying billions of user value as they go.\n\nWhile it may seem like small comfort for those that lost funds, this is actually the \u201cbest\u201d kind of black swan.  Nothing actually broke. Ethereum worked fine. Bitcoin worked fine.  A bunch of gamblers putting bets on bets on bets lost it all, and sadly a lot of that money wasn\u2019t theirs to lose. \n\nBut nothing actually broke or stopped working at the base level. In fact, as we shall see, some protocols had their most profitable period in their history, and an even smaller subset of those protocols pay those profits out to token holders. For a lucky few, this black swan was a money printer.\n\nSo what were the ground level plants under the big FTX tree, that now have an opportunity to shine?  The most obvious answer is provably fair decentralised perpetuals protocols. In other words, projects that do the same thing as FTX (perpetual trading contracts) but provide higher assurances of the safety of user funds. \n\nThere are a bunch of these that are probably worth looking into in the wake of FTX\u2019s collapse.  DYDX, which is launching a new version as a standalone COSMOS chain, is arguably the best and simplest user experience of all of them.\n\nGMX, criminally ignored on this subreddit, is a decentralised perpetuals exchange running on Arbitrum that consistently ranks third in fees generated after only Ethereum and Uniswap (see cryptofees.info).  Unlike those, however, it directly pays a proportion of fees to its users. So GMX stakers are currently enjoying &gt;$1m a day in fees (the highest fees ever generated by the platform) that are paid out to holders in GMX and ETH, and yet general hype about GMX is still very small and the token itself generally languishes outside the top 100. I don\u2019t expect that to last.\n\nGNS is a similar product to GMX, but running on Polygon, and offers trading pairs for anything that has a Chainlink price feed, so allows for decentralised trading of things like forex and precious metals.  Mycelium, an Australian GMX competitor with tweaked parameters, was consistently in the top 20 fee earning protocols in all of crypto over the last week, while languishing somewhere around rank #700 (lmao). \nAt a time when market sentiment is shocking, \u201creal value\u201d will be where the smart money accumulates, and what better metric for real value is there than the money a protocol earns in real user fees and passes on to its holders?\n\nIt is likely that decentralised perpetuals exchanges will see a lot of attention in coming months and years, and the collapse of FTX has thrown into sharp relief what happens when you take shortcuts around the guarantees provided by decentralisation and cryptographic proof, which leads me to my last recommendation.\n\nChainlink is not a perps exchange, but a suite of baseline infrastructure tools that other projects use in order to attain best-in-class security guarantees. Chainlink has quietly shipped top tier infrastructure for years, and despite completely dominating the markets where it functions, it was largely ignored last bull run as \u201cboring backend stuff\u201d.  Chainlink has offered a Proof of Reserves product since 2020, which in the wake of FTX failing is suddenly something that people understand the value of.\n\nCrypto at its heart has always been about replacing \u201cjust trust me, bro\u201d with provable guarantees backed by math.  In a bullrun it\u2019s easy to say \u201cwho cares\u201d, but when the most trustworthy faces turn out to be scammers, there is no better time to appreciate the value of cryptographic guarantees over paper promises.\n\nThe next generation of decentralised perpetuals exchanges will not be able to rely on \u201cjust trust me bro\u201d for much longer. Nobody who understands how oracle exploits and price feed manipulation works, will trust substandard security guarantees. Chainlink, by slowly building the highest security products in its niche, will more and more be come to be seen not as an option, but as a mandatory minimum standard for provable security and safety in DeFi products.\n\nOn top of this, Chainlink is very soon going to release its early iteration of staking, which will turn LINK tokens into yield bearing investments. At a time when sentiment is low and trust is even lower, Chainlink\u2019s promises of trust-minimised tooling become attractive in a way that is often ignored in the loud noises and hype cycles of a bull market.\n\nThis may not be the bottom. The reverberations of FTX\u2019s demise may cripple the markets for some time, but when sentiment comes back (and it always does) there will be an opportunity to ask more of the protocols where you are sending your money.  The guarantees provided by decentralisation, and by accountability and transparency through things like Proof of Reserve, will almost certainly make people look back on the events of 2022 as \u201cthe bad old days\u201d, never to be repeated.\n\ntl;dr There\u2019s quite a lot of research and alpha in here, if you can be bothered to read it.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ysuiz6\/when_a_big_tree_falls_in_the_forest\/","author":"Phallic","num_comments":9,"created_utc":1668221093000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ADVICE","title":"When a big tree falls in the forest\u2026","distinguished":null,"id":"ysuiz6","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":258,"selftext":"In case you haven't heard already, SBF's empire was revealed to be run by himself and 10 of his flatmates in the Bahamas. (See: [Link](https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2022\/11\/10\/bankman-frieds-cabal-of-roommates-in-the-bahamas-ran-his-crypto-empire-and-dated-other-employees-have-lots-of-questions\/) here) Yes, they ran **TWO** multi-billion dollar companies (FTX and Alameda) like a bunch of hedonistic kids and nobody publicly found out until this debacle unfolded.\n\nWhat did that Rudderless Ship look like? 'The luxury penthouse in the Bahamas is where 30-year-old Bankman-Fried is roommates with the inner circle who ran FTX and Alameda Research. All 10 are, or used to be, paired up in romantic relationships with each other. That includes Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison.' So yes, **all 10 of them, all key members of SBF's empire, were all literally screwing each other**.\n\nWho was the **CEO of Alameda Research**, who owned 15B of assets on paper? (Literally 'on paper' since it was inflated by imaginary FTT tokens, but still): SBF's ex-girlfriend, Caroline Ellison - a 28yo with little experience before being propelled to the CEO, an infamous Twitter [video](https:\/\/twitter.com\/HowieBTC\/status\/1590905563692806144) of the CEO looking and sounding absolutely clueless has been making its rounds.\n\nThe **COO of FTX**? Another 28yo lady leaving in the Bahamas, [Constance Wang](https:\/\/www.cryptobahamas.com\/speakers\/constance-wang). 2 full years of experience at Credit Suisse, and hey that's enough for SBF to promote her to be COO of his multibillion-dollar company! I'm sure living in the Bahamas penthouse had nothing to do with it..\n\nTurning the focus of the luxury ship now to the men living on it, if you thought it could not get worse it does. From the Coindesk link above:\n\n'Among his nine housemates are FTX co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Gary Wang, FTX Director of Engineering Nishad Singh and Ellison of Alameda. \u201cGary, Nishad and Sam control the code, the exchange's matching engine and funds,\u201d the first person familiar with the matter said. \u201cIf they moved them around or input their own numbers, I'm not sure who would notice.\"\n\nGreat, so 2 of SBF's lovers who he is still having orgies with are CEO and COO respectively, while his **3 FTX bros control the keys to all the customer's funds**. Now it has been revealed that they were screwing around with customer's money playing shitcoins.\n\nAnd this is my favourite SBF tweet of the entire debacle. 'Yes we might be headless monkeys, but all you stakeholders had the chance to look at our governance and do something about it before, but didn't until shit went south'\n\n['Thanks for the blind trust in us running FTX to the ground, but now we're found out!'](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ojmzpwfs5gz91.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fe2cc1273cff650b974a1fc6f265334c44cbf21)\n\nIt's astounding how **NONE** of the millions of retail customers with billions worth of funds, wall street, institutional funds did some basic research on how FTX\/Alameda was actually being run, and it only all came out after shit went south and everyone got hurt. Well, I guess the moral of the story is everyone is too busy to give a shit about anything when they are making money - and perhaps next time we put our savings into something, we should try to make sure that the CEO of the company isn't having orgies in the Bahamas and promoting his lovers to look after all your assets.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yswh2z\/the_unfolding_of_sbfs_empire_a_rudderless_ship\/","author":"Every_Hunt_160","num_comments":166,"created_utc":1668227390000,"edited":1668228365000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"The unfolding of SBF's empire: A Rudderless ship led by a hedonistic captain where orgies and nepotism ran rampant in the Bahamas","distinguished":null,"id":"yswh2z","downs":null,"ups":null}

You will need them to file a Proof of Claim for Chapter 11.**\n\nThe FTX site is not working anymore. All the balances, trading, portfolio, etc. are not displaying at all. This is bad for people who did not saved their information yet. However, there are still ways for you to maintain some records:\n\n* If you have tried to withdraw from FTX, keep the email confirmations you received as evidence.\n* If you already took screenshots of your portfolio, that's good.\n* Use external wallets and other exchanges to track transactions you had to\/from FTX.\n* Any correspondence with their support team.\n* Emails of your recent transactions.\n\nRight now FTX is filing a Chapter 11. They will submit a Schedules of Assets and Liabilities. This Schedules will list how much FTX owes to creditors. Your name needs to be listed on the Schedules for you to claim a payment from the proceedings.\n\nIF YOU ARE NOT LISTED ON THE SCHEDULES, YOU WILL NOT GET PAID!\n\nIf your name is not listed, or the listed amount is incorrect, you will need to file a Proof of Claim. This is a form that allows you to file a claim on your assets on FTX. There will be a deadline called a Bar Date that you will have to file this form by.\n\nRight now the Chapter 11 just started but you should gather all your records now. You don't want to do this months later when you don't remember how much you have or already deleted your emails.\n\n**Identify Theft Precaution**\n\nI see questions about personal information, so here's some points:\n\n* Your personal data is probably already compromised. Contact your country's regulator to report a GDPR data breach. \n* Contact your credit bureau to report an identity theft. Request for a fraud alert be placed in your file so creditors have to call your before opening or changing accounts.\n* Regularly check your credit history for any new inquiries, accounts, or addresses. Fraudsters have racked up large debts using stolen identities for years before victims became aware.\n* Monitor your banks and cards transactions for suspicious activity. \n\nThis is just a precaution. You can get lucky and nothing bad will happened to you. But being cautious will save you weeks, if not months, of having to go to court to clear your fraudulent debts. The collection agency will not give a fuck if you were a victim, they only care about getting their money. Your credit will also take a hit if the debts are registered on your credit rating.\n\nEdit: Change the points to reflect the current \"hack.\"\n\nEdit: Add some ponts about identity theft.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ysxw10\/ftx_site_is_shutting_down_keep_all_your_records\/","author":"FatCryptoBear","num_comments":91,"created_utc":1668232236000,"edited":1668269542000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ADVICE","title":"FTX Site Is Shutting Down.

Remember? Barings Bank was eventually sold to a competing bank for 1 British Pound. \n\nAnyway, let's make our new movie.\n\nHere is the plot as it unfolded, and we can even put these same characters as cast.\n\n1. FTX is always the high-flying exchange in the crypto space.\n2. SBF is a man with a mission - to ensure all customers become homeless.\n3. He keeps a pretty face and affable character with all, including competing exchanges.\n4. He Shakes hands with CZ many times.\n5. Backstabs CZ by using his useless power in DC to build a wall against CZ.\n6. Crypto winter, with all its prowling wolves enter the domain. (Could be a horror movie as well)\n7. Slowly the wolves gnaw at the FTX empire revealing its financial irregularities.\n8. SBF claims funds are SAFU.\n9. Then it comes to light that things are DARNU.\n10. SBF removes his tweet claiming SAFU to save face.\n11. Things go down like no tomorrow.\n12. But wait, CZ the white knight arrives.\n13. CZ claims he can help revive FTX only to kick SBF hard between the legs.\n14. SBF goes sobbing to mumma.\n15. Too late for anyone to do anything.\n16. Withdrawls have to stop to arrest the slide.\n17. They plant their own cronies who help people remove their money through Bahamas.\n18. But nothing seems to work.\n19. SBF through his useless employees leaks a mail on Twitter claiming to be caring for his customers and wanting to get things right. (Yeahhh, right.)\n20. Slide continues.\n21. Second White Knight in SCUM armor arrives. Justin STUN.\n22. Unknown to all he was here to reclaim his own miserable life.\n23. Too late. Reclaiming s\\*it only leaves you with s\\*it. And so, STUN stuns SBF and makes a quick exit.\n24. SBF applies for bankruptcy. All the while claiming he cares for the customers.\n25. Customers are vying for his blood and are sure he will be behind bars. After all, Barings Bank esnured that some one paid for the mistakes.\n26. And when things looked bleak for SBF, his mumma, the real lady knight saves him by using her network of politicians.\n27. On your face investors, traders and small time cryptoers. \n28. The world moves on as SBF succeeds in his mission - everyone is homeless!! Oh how novel of our hero!!\n\nAhhhh... Man this saga. We can even think of releasing it in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

But it makes a lot of sense, if you want to introduce the narrative of a \"safer CBDC\". The only thing you need to do before that is shaking the confidence in \"crypto\". Of course they have no power over decentralized projects, but they can make centralized institutions fail.\n\nSeriously guys. This is exactly the time to look at the bigger picture. We all know that CBDCs will be introduced in 2023. From a chart perspective the cryptomarket seems to have bottomed or was close to a bottom. And exactly then FTX blows up and takes big parts of the unsound side of the ecosystem with it. Which is good. Don't get me wrong. It's a pre-requisite for a more major market.\n\nBut it could also mean that real decentralized projects are out of their reach and for the manufacturing of a narrative they only had excess to shady centralized projects that they (always?) intended to blow up at the right time?\n\nThe story seems to be giving and what easily can be ascribed to stupidity can also be ascribed to malice on all levels.\n\nThis is meant to encourage you to **think outside of the box** and not to believe in everything you hear. **Question things**.\n\n&gt;  \u201cIt is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.\u201d\n\n\u2015 Aristotle","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yt043m\/after_all_i_have_read_on_the_fall_of_the_ftx\/","author":"gr8ful4","num_comments":37,"created_utc":1668239279000,"edited":1668239517000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"SPECULATION","title":"After all I have read on the fall of the FTX empire, it's hard to believe that at least parts of it have NOT been pre-planned.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":9,"selftext":"A few weeks ago. I reported an abnormality in the trading features of the FTX backlog servers. To access all API endpoints at FTX you required authentication. And I noticed a particular access on November 5th, 2022. That had none of this access requirement.\n\nThis issue was also apparent with the Real-time market data which is captured via multiple WebSocket connections and the FTX servers that were located in AWS ap-northeast-1 region (Tokyo, Japan).\n\nI sent this data to the FTX hierarchy. It took then 16hrs to get back to me. \n\nFTX just had poor hierarchy. And I am disappointed for having any affiliations with them. \n\nHere is why FTX self imploded. FTX misused users funds, and started damage control when it was too late. The Large volume of withdrawals also did not help. The value of our FTX's token, FTT, plummeting was an additional nail on the coffin, taking other coins with it was just the next step\n\nA mixture of poor management, corruption were all a reason why FTX crashed. \n\nAfter FTX US halted withdrawals and trading.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":0,"selftext":"I tried to explain with [the Schr\u00f6dinger crypto enthusiast](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yrlvh4\/the_schr\u00f6dinger_crypto_enthusiast\/).\n\nThen again after someone said [\u201cI used to be anti regulation, but the FTX debacle playing out right now has convinced me otherwise\u201d](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ysy73b\/i_used_to_be_anti_regulation_but_the_ftx_debacle\/). There will be many posts like this, in this bear, and in every bear, until CBDCs are the only legal crypto, if that ever happens.\n\nLet me try to explain again:\n\n&gt; Disintermediated, trustless, decentralized,\u2026 that's crypto.\n&gt; \n&gt; You take those out, all you have is psychopaths running scams.\n&gt; \n&gt; You regulate the psychopaths, you get TradFi.\n\nThe value proposition of crypto is in the disintermediation, trustlessness, and decentralization. There's:\n- No intermediate psychopath in the top 1% to try to regulate.\n- No intermediate psychopath in the top 1% that you need to trust.\n- No organization centralized in a psychopath in the top 1% answering to congress, lobbying, going to jail,\u2026\n\nIf you add those things, you get CBDCs. CBDCs are not necessarily bad, they allow for tokenization of the economy: stocks, commodities, ETFs, ETCs, ETNs, CFDs, mortgages, all kinds of derivatives,\u2026 everything (really).\n\nHowever, CBDCs are not decentralized, trustless, or disintermediated. Arguably, you do not need a blockchain for CBDCs, a database will do as long as it follows some standards (shared by the intermediaries to exchange the tokens). CBDCs are TradFi.\n\nTradFi is not necessarily a bad thing as much as it is a necessary evil for current modern societies. At least until we have better alternatives, if they are allowed to exist. The tokenization of TradFi would be an improvement, inspired and motivated by crypto, but it is not a paradigm shift.\n\nThe paradigm shift is disintermediation, trustlessness, and decentralization. Sorry for the repetition. Many more people will be repeating similar words in every and each bear, every time people forget \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d, until it is:\n\n* unnecessary, because the paradigm shift is clear, or\n* useless, because it has been prevented, and there are only CBDCs, if any tokens.\n\nI know it is important to remind these words, because in every bull they are forgotten and replaced with profit, taxes, adoption, etc. Then, intermediaries appear as friendly entrepreneurs that are going to give you risk free returns beyond the boring returns of TradFi.\n\nBoomers investing in the S&amp;P 500 just don't get how dogs and apes are so much better investments to have a chance at retiring, ever. Then, crypto just goes up because it is not constrained by any fundamental value, only the speculative value and its ponzinomics. Until the next bear brings rationality back. Because no bull is forever.\n\nThe fundamental value of crypto is in its disintermediation, trustlessness, and decentralization. If it wasn't valuable and important, China would not have banned it, every other week.\n\nWith central banks causing decades high inflation (supposedly transitory) and a recession to stop it, the value proposition of crypto and how TradFi fails and causes pain should be more clear than ever.\n\nBut crypto is not only Bitcoin and algorithmic monetary policy anymore, it is tokenization, and more importantly, disintermediation, trustlessness, and decentralization.\n\nHTH (it may not be the last time I write something similar)","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yt0my7\/why_regulation_doesnt_help\/","author":"Trylks","num_comments":21,"created_utc":1668240841000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"PERSPECTIVE","title":"why regulation doesn't help","distinguished":null,"id":"yt0my7","downs":null,"ups":null}

His brother is a former Wall Street trader. Bankrupt-Fraud was a smart kid, he attended Canada\/USA Mathcamp, a summer program for mathematically talented high-school students.\n\nSus Bankrupt-Fraud was working shoulder to shoulder with wall-street degenerates but had a different approach to money.\n\nIn January 2018, Bankrupt-Fraud found a gap to fill and make a lot of money $$, so he organised an arbitrage trade, moving up to $25M per day, to take advantage of the higher price of bitcoin in Japan compared to in America.\n\nSus and his friend founded FTX, a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, in April 2019, and it then launched the following month. FTX began within Alameda Research, a trading firm founded by Bankrupt-Fraud and others in 2017 in Berkeley, California. After they moved all their business to the Bahamas.\n\nThere was a lot of cash $$$ flow so everyone wanted in ( just like the wolf of wall street ).\n\nBut because Bankrupt-Fraud is not the typical Wolf of Wall-street he was driving a Corolla ( while having multiple European cars ) and he likes to play with money in different ways.\n\nSus was the second largest donor to Biden campaign, when CoinDesk reached out to Bankrupt-Fraud he declined to be interviewed for their article so CoinDesk were like wtf bro\ud83d\ude21.\n\nIn September 2022, it was revealed that Fraud had offered Elon Musk billions of dollars ( not in Doge or Shiba but $$$ ) to fund his purchase of Twitter. According to messages released as part of the lawsuit between Twitter and Musk during the latter's proposed acquisition of Twitter, on April 25, 2022, investment banker Michael Grimes wrote that Bankrupt-Fraud would be willing to commit up to $5 billion.\n\nOn 2 November 2022, CoinDesk said: hey Sus do you remember us? It\u2019s pay back time biaaatch!!! They published an article stating that a significant portion of Alameda Research's assets were held in FTT, the exchange token issued by FTX. At the time the CoinDesk article was published, reporter Ian Allison wrote that there were $5.1 billion worth of FTT tokens in circulation, and that Alameda's balance sheet held $3.66 billion of \"unlocked FTT\", $2.16 billion of \"FTT collateral\", and $292 million of \"locked FTT\".\n\nMr Sus was taking real cash $$$ and spending it left and right ( not really right ) while him and his boys were adding the 000s into FTT out of thin air ( this last bit is just to spicy it up ).\n\nThis story is ongoing with new insights of how it all happened unfolding every other day.\n\nSus Bankrupt-Fraud once said:\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about having an impact on the world, I think that the point at which there\u2019s nothing more to do with resources to help make the world better, you\u2019re talking about pretty big numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cI think at least tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions and maybe trillions.\u201d\n\nWell Mr Sus you definitely made a huge impact because now a lot of people are bankrupt while you run away with all those Billions.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yt2mru\/the_wolf_of_crypto\/","author":"El_ai","num_comments":21,"created_utc":1668247007000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"COMEDY","title":"The Wolf of Crypto","distinguished":null,"id":"yt2mru","downs":null,"ups":null}

I feel your pain, and I totally understand your frustrations. For the sake of the innocent customers and employees who had nothing to do with this mess, I hope every effort is made to make everyone whole.\n\nIt's people like SBF who make it seem like crypto needs \"an adult in the room\". However, the truth of the matter is that this space is fully capable of self regulation. We don't need the government to be the adult in the room because it goes against the very ethos of crypto: peer to peer, permissionless, trustless, decentralized.\n\nDespite the painful experience we've had over the last few days, there's a lot of lessons to be learnt. \n\n1. First and most importantly, this situation has reemphasized the golden rule of crypto that \"not your keys, not your crypto\". People should not leave their crypto on exchanges for longer than is necessary. Get a wallet and be in full custody of your crypto.\n\n2. Secondly, it will become industry standard for CEXs to provide publicly audited proof of reserves that is verifiable on-chain. Going forward, any CEX that will not adhere to this new norm will not attract customers. \n\n3. Lastly, the fallout of FTX has highlighted the need for the space to have DEX trading tools that are just as good as those on a CEX. One of the biggest reasons people leave their funds on a CEX is because they have opened several positions, buy orders, and sell orders that are waiting to be filled. Very few DEX trading platforms can do this. However, we have a good number of upcoming dApps where traders can open trading positions while still keeping custody of their funds in the wallet.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yt37g1\/lessons_from_ftx_so_far\/","author":"economist_kinda","num_comments":36,"created_utc":1668248745000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"PERSPECTIVE","title":"Lessons from FTX so far...","distinguished":null,"id":"yt37g1","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":126,"selftext":"Dear all,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConsidering all what is happening in the crypto sphere and happened in the past (celsius, voyager, FTX ...etc), I think I have to explain my situation as well on how I lost everything I had on AAVE.\n\nFirst of all, let me give you a little bit of context to understand how it happened:\n\n\\- AAVE deployed on harmony following a governance vote ([https:\/\/governance.aave.com\/t\/arc-aave-market-launch-on-harmony\/5065](https:\/\/governance.aave.com\/t\/arc-aave-market-launch-on-harmony\/5065))\n\n\\- Harmony AAVE was incentivised by Harmony fundation to encourage users to deposit and borrow funds there\n\nI, then decided to lend my harmony ONE tokens there relying on the AAVE reputation and seeing that it seemed covered in case of any major events by the safety module as shown on the harmony aave application.\n\n[Safety module on AAVE Harmony market](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/m0ciboc9aiz91.png?width=1248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a38214c82e723d548e535bc181adae6ff803bce8)\n\nThen, the nightmare started not so long after.\n\n\\- Harmony bridge got hacked and drained from the ETH bridged tokens the 24th June 2022. Meaning that the ETH tokens on harmony lost 90% of their value.\n\nNow, you might be wondering **how I lost all my ONE tokens that I lended on harmony AAVE since those are not ETH coins but native harmony coins**. I will explain this below:\n\n\\- AAVE relies on an oracle (chainlink) which did not take into consideration the bridge hack for the ETH tokens USD value, hence USDC lended on harmony AAVE were still considered as 1 USD in the AAVE application when the real value on the chain was around 10cents of USD.\n\n\\- Some people exploited AAVE: they bought 1USDC on chain for 10cents per USDC, then lended them on AAVE, and were able to borrow for 60% of the USDC they deposited.\n\nTo give an example: you buy 1 1USDC on harmony chain for 10cents of USD, then lend it on AAVE, and you were able to borrow for around 60cents USD of native tokens. (ONE and LINK tokens are listed on AAVE)\n\n\\- Those persons drained all ONE and LINK liquidities using this exploit mechanism.\n\n\\- Most of this exploit happened the next day of the bridge hack because lending and borrowing were still opened on AAVE since no immediate actions has been taken by AAVE. On the other side, the other leader on harmony for lending\/ borrowing [https:\/\/app.tranquil.finance\/](https:\/\/app.tranquil.finance\/) disabled everything in the next few hours of the bridge hack and prevented this same exploit to happen.\n\n[https:\\\/\\\/talk.harmony.one\\\/t\\\/harmony-aave\\\/21008\\\/33](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yf8r5zcbaiz91.png?width=555&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2b39710e9ef1c5d2a29141c884dc2ae9bfcf37a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis exploit lead to the following current situation on AAVE\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Current Harmony AAVE market](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fj6xr0pdaiz91.png?width=1450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=161726d76dc1705857ac682a80315ca36eb3a1e4)\n\n\\- All native coins have an utilization to 100%, hence it is impossible for the users to withdraw their deposited ONE and LINK.\n\n\\- Since the utilization on ONE and LINK was 100%, the current formula for the supply APY on AAVE was displaying 1020% on ONE and LINK deposits, encouraging much more users to deposit and become exit liquidities for others without necessarly realizing it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[LINK APY displayed during a monthe on AAVE \\(same went for ONE with an APY more than 1000&amp;#37;\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/tvldefeadiz91.png?width=1249&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e370fc2ad9ee712c67cde08abc65a5be769a9c26)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Because of oracle price exploit, **AAVE accumulated a bad debt of around 900k USD for which the ONE and LINK lenders paid for.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What happened for me and other impacted users?**\n\n\\- My ONE tokens are stuck on AAVE since 5 months with no possibilities to withdraw since the utilization rate is 100% and market is frozen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What happened since June 2022 for the users?**\n\nI was then thinking that it would be solved by AAVE which is the leader for lending\/ borrowing, considering that the amount exploited is ridiculous compared to the fees they are collecting from each AAVE markets.

A potential bailout would represent only one or two days of AAVE fees to make users whole from this exploit and as well would show that AAVE cares on its users and can be trusted in the dangerous crypto sphere.

IT  IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO VISIT THIS PAGE NOW AS THE SITE MAY HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED AND HOST MALWARE***\n\nThe balance sheet of Alameda Research on June 26th had $3.66 Billion in 'unlocked FTT'. Now take a look the FTT supply on the FTX page on 4th November, just a week ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[4th Nov](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mgazz5tjadz91.png?width=815&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70dbd199ae182d224ca8cf397acae11c7ecaf581)\n\nThis shows a circulating supply of 118,597,824FTT. However, only a few days later FTT supply looked like this. These supply increased somewhere between the 6th Nov and the 11th Nov.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[By 10th Nov](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jhoyythpadz91.png?width=987&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbeb325db353f4e7a53470930f57dbb98a56680b)\n\nSuddenly there were an EXTRA 129,754,263 FTT tokens in the circulating supply. I previously wrote about [SBF and Alameda's Infinite Money Scheme](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yoof8g\/sbf_and_alameda_research_allegedly_using_ftx_in\/). Basically, FTX would freely print FTT tokens that would then been cheaply lent or realistically freely given to Alameda Research. These tokens *never affected prices* because they *never hit the actual market* and thus do not affect the *circulating supply.* Hence, free money.\n\nNow part of the reason the FTT price crashed 80% thus far was not just market selling, but also Alameda suddenly dumping the aforementioned 129,754,263  tokens onto the market, **more than doubling the circulating supply**.\n\nI am fairly sure this is what they did as I can explain using the $3.66B in free FTT tokens they had on June 30th. FTX started encountering real issues and halted withdrawals on the 8th Nov. By this time The value of FTT fell about 2\/3, dropping the $3.66B in FTT to $2.44B. FTT then liquidated this $2.44B and **dumped a sudden 129,654,263 tokens onto the market** more than doubling circulating supply. This would mean they sold at around $18.81, exactly around the price FTT was at that point. **All these numbers and dates line up perfectly.**\n\nThe irony is that all the supply charts from Coinmarketcap to coingecko to etherscan *all show the circulating supply* ***still*** *at* a bit over 100 million while FTX FTT page is **the only site showing a more than 2X supply**. Sketchy as hell but now we see how the game works.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CoinGecko](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/tfyw9m2ridz91.png?width=418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=086fdb89d6b4c7f473d9dc239525dd75d76af56a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CMC](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/afoyk2qridz91.png?width=238&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2ee8997a49a3aa083f8647c38f39a237c70a2ed)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Etherscan: Translates to 132,351,963 FTT](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zs7sa6tqkdz91.png?width=222&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef9804efbdc0ce666f5c80eefe0dce18a631ca52)\n\nSure the market sold but make no mistake SBF, Alameda and FTX tanked their own token to try and save themselves from the huge debt\/customer deposits they could not repay. Of course, this extra $2.44B was not enough.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":12,"selftext":"Kraken enjoys rave reviews, not least because its customer service staff answer enquiries at lightning speed. FTX was my go-to exchange whenever I needed to move my shitcoins accumulated on Kucoin to somewhere else. But since FTX has bitten the dust, I decided to find out more about Kraken since it is so well loved here. The following details my DYOR - I specifically zeroed in on the cons associated with Kraken so that I open an account with my eyes open and don\u2019t get any unnecessary shocks later on. May my notes be of some use to you.\n\n\nAreas of Improvement \n\n1. Limited crypto availability in comparison to other exchanges. Also, you can only withdraw a minimum of $5k in one day.\n\n2. Kraken does not support the Polygon network, so you will have to send MATIC through the Ethereum blockchain. We all know how prohibitively expensive ETH gas fees are. Worse still, it isn\u2019t all that apparent on the app that Kraken doesn\u2019t employ the Polygon network, so it\u2019s quite usual for people to lose their funds as they mistakenly send MATIC on the wrong network.\n\n3. Recurring buys are not automated as yet. You have to create an API-Key within your account and incorporate python script in order to set up recurring buys yourself.\n\n4. Trading platform can be made more comprehensive. Features like \u201corder triggers order\u201d and \u201corder cancels order\u201d could make trading more intuitive for inexperienced traders. On the other hand, serious and seasoned traders may find that the platform lacks features that they can leverage (pun intended).\n\n5. No instant free ACH deposits and withdrawals. ACH deposits of USD are not available yet; one has to buy individual coins with ACH.\n\n6. For people in certain states like Texas, depositing fiat incurs more fees compared to doing so for other exchanges because they can only currently onboard fiat through wire transfers.\n\n7. Do not support the Binance Chain (BNB) or the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) (BEP20\/BEP2 Tokens), which may limit opportunities for some investors.\n\nHow else do you think Kraken can do better?","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ytbfgu\/nothing_is_perfect_neither_is_kraken\/","author":"cryotosensei","num_comments":46,"created_utc":1668269943000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"Nothing is perfect.

The only thing that matters is being in the machine zone, because their problems and the rest of reality fade out of existence while they're in it. \n\nSince then people have applied this concept to social media, to explain why people just scroll and scroll through feeds on websites like facebook, reddit, etc. [https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2013\/07\/the-machine-zone-this-is-where-you-go-when-you-just-cant-stop-looking-at-pictures-on-facebook\/278185\/](https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2013\/07\/the-machine-zone-this-is-where-you-go-when-you-just-cant-stop-looking-at-pictures-on-facebook\/278185\/)\n\nThis FTX situation put me in that zone.

The current Co-CEO of Alameda Research (yes, that one girl that is leading Alameda with elementary school maths) is the daughter of SEC chairman Gary Gensler\u2018s boss at MIT. Also SBF went to MIT and helped a lot to create Alameda Research there.\n\n2. The general counsel of FTX US was the lead counsel for Gary Gensler at the CFTC.

To make it worse they made **risky loans** into coins that have collapse leaving large holes in their balance sheet - in short they can't pay back the money because it's gone. However, the real driver of the price increases was **stablecoins** but we'll get into those later.\n\n**Exchanges been operating for such a long time, how can they be fraudulent**? \n\nCrypto, in terms of financial technology, is unique because several layers of financial fraud can be hidden behind layers of technical jargon and financial instruments. Imagine if you have several banks working together to keep prices high and give each other credit when needed. Now imagine that you hide this behind a series of **stablecoins and tokens** until the point where everything looks good - everything is holding value, liquidity is being pumped into the system, prices are going up, what can go wrong? Well, when you are over-leveraged and you have a downturn, maybe even not crypto related (say inflation caused by a pandemic), you start to have pressure. Prices come down, people pull out money, and you can't cover up the losses anymore. This is FTX right now.\n\n**LUNA started this and FTX is finishing this, so we're good now right**?\n\n**No**. People get caught up in what's on fire **right now** and the **price of assets (**specifically how well BTC\/ETH is doing**)**. **You're looking in the wrong place.**\n\nFinancial collapses can be hard to predict and take a long time to unfold but I believe **the underlying analysis is correct in that the whole system is propped up on fraudulent leverage.** There are three things people need to be watching right now: the centralized exchanges, ones that have their own token, and **by far the most important - stablecoins**.\n\nThe first one is simple, centralized exchanges take user funds and gamble them on unsound investments. Could the investments be good? Maybe, without an audit who knows, but a lot of these exchanges wrap up liquidity in incredibly risky positions and with the collapse of tokens these balances sheets are hit hard. **What does this have to do with exchange tokens?** Centralized exchanges print tokens for one reason - to create credit to then invest in speculation. Now if you're Bitfinex and you're already lending out funds within the exchange and now you're also **stretching leverage** into a token which value is propped up by your exchange (i.e. your user funds) and those tokens start to crash, what happens? **You use your user funds to backstop it**. This is what happened to FTX, this is currently what's happening to other exchanges (Binance\/Bitfinex). If they have too much leverage on their books - things don't work out so well.\n\nNow, **stablecoins.** I'm actually fine with you ignoring the above analysis (although evidence of FTX should suggest otherwise). **But please for the love of crypto go look into stablecoins -** it is a **beautiful idea (Maker\/DAI)** that's turned into a **monstrosity by crooks**. I'm fine with you ignoring me but go research stablecoins, know what they are, look how they're propagated.\n\nYou think, why stablecoins? Who cares about a token that's supposed to be pegged to a dollar? Well, remember that thing about leverage above - **what do you think all of that leverage is propped up on**? That's right,  **stablecoins**. Now, and this is **absolutely fucking wild**, who owns the largest stablecoin **Tether**? That's right, Bitfinex. What stablecoin do these large exchanges (especially Binance) have on their books? That's right, **Tether**. In who's best interest is it to keep the real price of Tether hidden so that they can leverage up their positions and make **wild speculative investments?** I think you get where I'm going with this. The entire crypto space is built upon the **idea that Tether can be redeemed** for actual dollars. That if pressured Tether could return every single cent to every person. But this seems **very unlikely**. And Tether is **everywhere**, I used to think Ethereum was safe from Tether but all of the assets (even the good protocols) are propped up with Tether. It has a hold on the **entire space**.\n\nLet's reword this. I am an exchange, you give me your life savings and I transfer it to Tether, I put your money in investments and since I own the very currency you think you own **I can set the price to whatever I want it to be**. Now imagine it's not just me but and **entire system** upon which it's in our collective interest to keep **the one currency we all operate on pegged to a dollar**. So not only are centralized exchanges operating on a fractional reserve **the very stablecoin the system relies on ITSELF IS OPERATING ON A FRACTIONAL RESERVE.** That is **fucking crazy**. That means that even if Tether isn't actually a dollar, which it most likely isnt, we - the exchanges which **SHOW YOU THE PRICE OF TETHER** \\- can say it's a dollar. Is this sustainable, can it continue forever? In the wise words of Jordan Belfort \"**Absolutely fucking not.**\"\n\nNo one knows except for the owners of Tether the actual value of Tether and it's reserve ratio - it is absolutely not 1:1 - so what is it? 1:10? 1:1000? 1:10000? What happens if the leverage is too great and Tethers cannot be redeemed? Well, the peg will break and go to **zero**.\n\n**And the peg is already starting to break - the system is already on fire**. Please, please get out of the house.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ytfnd2\/now_that_the_music_has_stopped_its_time_to_pay\/","author":"ben_kird","num_comments":245,"created_utc":1668280156000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANALYSIS","title":"Now that the music has stopped - it's time to pay attention","distinguished":null,"id":"ytfnd2","downs":null,"ups":null}

What I do have to say is that I not we owe him major credit because he was right about SBF all along. Whether it was a guess or he really did have a source who gave him accurate info or he did his research about the man and FTX he was right. So for that I owe him credit. \n\nToday BitBoy is gloating and he deserves it. He earned it. Whatever you think of the man this is his moment to enjoy. He basically called out SBF for being a fraud, backstabbing other CEX with regulators and also hammering down on the dubious financial activities of SBF and FTX. So I must give credit where credit is due. When I heard him speak about these topics I gave him no credit. I was even dismissive and thought to myself \"This idiot will say anything for a buck\". Well, I was wrong and I admit it. There is no shame in that. I judged the guy and he proved me wrong.\n\nI still feel there is a lot of wrong in Bitboy's approach to crypto and I can't stand the guy for many obvious reasons that have been discussed here ad nauseum but for now I'll end with this I was dead effin wrong and Bitboy was 100% right. \n\nThere you go Bitboy.

Please do not misinterpret this post as \u201cCoinbase being the better exchange;\u201d I\u2019m simply stating that something of Binance\u2019s caliber should not be falling on deaf ears when it comes to regulations and money. This should be the biggest red flag in and of itself. The BNB token is, in my opinion no different from what other failed exchanges had to offer: lowering trading fees and artificially inflated value to avoid being recognized as a security. These types of exchanges prey on the consumer looking to escape financial burden by offering incentives for using their platform and inviting others to as well. I could in fact state that the BSC token is probably worse seeing as it paved for the way for even more rugpulls that promise the world but offer nothing of value. It\u2019s the same as FTX but promoted differently and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they are also caught leveraging their customer\u2019s funds. The sooner people read this post and see that for what it is the sooner you\u2019ll know what the black swans are. Also keep in mind that the CEO became the 30th richest person in the world within 5 years and is not regulated by anyone. You\u2019re placing too much trust in the wrong hands folks. Ironically this happens to be a controversial take seeing as they\u2019re the \u201c#1 CEX\u201d but absolutely NOTHING is too big to fail.\n\nUp next, tether: Do I even have to explain this coin shady history\/backstory?! It\u2019s controlled by literally a handful of people and because it has such dominance in the markets today I can say that it\u2019s single handedly one of the biggest reasons BTC is the price that it is today. If you need a refresher on Tether\u2019s backstory, let me know so I can update this post for you.\n\nCrypto.com: The owner  and CEO of this company (Kris) has a history of fucking over his customers and investors and also of running his businesses to the ground. If you didn\u2019t know, well now you do. I suggest you do some research on this one to get the full insight as to why I believe crypto.com will probably also end up going under.

In 2021 that company confirmed $1b in revenue for FTX and has since then been very proud of having a relationship with FTX.\n\nNow obviously they are not so proud. As the crypto newsletter CoinDesk approached them, their \"chief metaverse officer\" (a real role nowadays) said he does not not know anything about FTX and even said: \"I'm retired\".\n\nThat's all literally jokes but further highlights how important it is to not just get an audit done or a proof of reserve but it's also highly important by whom it is done.

The exchange was not a lending platform so using any funds would be wrong\/illegal. The likelihood that SBF was trading against his own users, as to why FTX liquidations were always so disproportionately high compared to other exchanges, will likely be proven soon as well and made public. \n\nBut I haven't been able to make much sense of the whole BlockFi connection or Gary Gensler. SBF was cozying up to a lot of politicians, and being friends with Gary could simply be related to his gf\/CEO Caroline having known Gensler, and SBF wanting to be friendly with the SEC. If SBF did in fact de-peg LUNA with the initial massive short to hurt the market and lenders then BlockFi could've been collateral damage like Celsius apparently was (bankrupting Voyageur DID benefit FTX greatly and it is public information since the information can be obtained from the legal proceedings). \n\nBUT SBF moved in on BlockFi, offering the credit line, also public knowledge, and bailing them out. Apparently the reasoning for this was because SBF took the BlockFi assets and stored them on the FTX exchange. BlockFi will likely legally confirm this soon instead of the heresay we have gotten so far from former employees. These assets, if worked on the books like the FTT token was between FTX and Alameda, means it could have simply been a shield company to help make FTX look whole and be a source of new crypto for Sam to use the backdoor on and spend. \n\nAnd then I remembered that the SEC sued BlockFi and won in February 2022. \n\nThis is the conspiracy theory, and I usually am not big on this but right now this is all just so wild and crazy. SBF could've targeted BlockFi as well if he had been able to obtain court documents on BlockFi from the SEC. Wouldn't have to be Gary who did it (as much as we'd like to see him get wrapped up in the corruption), but just one person could've handed that over to SBF and like he targeted LUNA and his own traders on FTX by mining the data he could've targeted BlockFi to hurt them with the crash in a disproportionate amount compared to other lenders or exchanges having BlockFi's financial information in hand. The case can be looked up and anyone can see the investigating officers. I will be curious if ever there is some interesting information that comes to light about any one of these investigators with a connection to SBF. \n\nTo be fair, everyone knew BlockFi was hit hard by the SEC filing and $100 mil paid out. No conspiracy theory needed. SBF is certainly an opportunist. This is kind of adding steps to the process. \n\nBut where Ripple visited the SEC and was sued THAT day and SBF and FTX weren't ...

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":94,"selftext":"**DISCLAIMER:** Before it's raining downvotes from DOGE enthusiasts I want to clarify this post is only pointing out the manipulation that abuses the crypto. **This is no financial advice &amp; no negative post about DOGE. No hate for the Crypto itself.** There are a lot of retail investors that fall for these schemes. I will talk about DOGE as an investment at the end of the post.\n\n# What is a Pump &amp; Dump scheme?\n\n* Pump-and-dump is an illegal scheme to boost an asset price based on false, misleading, or greatly **exaggerated statements**.\n* Pump-and-dump schemes usually target micro- and small-cap assets.\n* in crypto they target alts with lower trading volume to artificially create FOMO and therefore exit liqiudity to cash out afterwards\n\n# SIGNS FOR A Pump &amp; Dump scheme in crypto\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/00xyzuuy4n8a1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1252ab7fab19c1bcd0237fe1f9d79f0b0a1fcdc9\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/eqo9ymkz4n8a1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02932b54d8cec0258dcf4c65fe578068d1fcaf2b\n\nAs you can see in the charts above there are outstanding spikes when you compare DOGE x BTC. Everytime those spikes happen they usually lead to a dump after back or close to the level before closer to the BTC chart.\n\n# But why are whales doing this ?\n\nIt is highly illegal to do that in the stock market. The SEC and other stock market commissions are on high alert when institutions and market makers do that with penny stocks. However, in crypto it is harder for them to spot and therefore whales have an easier time to get away with it.\n\n**People found guilty of running pump-and-dump schemes are subject to heavy fines &amp; potential jail.**\n\n# And how are they doing it?\n\nIt is pretty simple. Imagine you are a whale with $100 million liquid in USDT. You buy the entire DOGE offered on the market on news ( popular recent example is Twitter ). The volume on DOGE is generally low for being an alt coin. So the price you pay to fill all orders and push the price up +10-20% isn't that high compared to BTC or ETH for example.\n\nThe Pump happens and it attracts retail investors but also other whales that jump on the train. The price is pushing upwards - further and further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/78cgreg05n8a1.png?width=539&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=481e81ce6dff80cc0daac53aeb31039145ba8ce0\n\nTake a look at the volume. You can clearly see the biggest volume by far hits when it already reached the peak. That is exaclty when those whales cash out the bought DOGE. The difference is the $100 Million they paid to push up the price can now be sold in the higher range without pushing down the price equal amount. Therefore they profit out of the higher volume \/ liquidity. If just 5-10% more liquidity was added at peak they already profit $5-10 million.\n\n# How can I avoid it or profit out of this?\n\nThe best way to avoid it is comparing the price movement with Bitcoin and ask yourself : Are the news really worth the pump? A recent example of Twitter using DOGE as a payment were just rumors. Elon Musk might have a plan to add the payment option but that might take a long time. A lot can happen in the crypto world until then. ( just looking at FTX drama for example )Usually what bigger investors do is ride the wave. Either spot the price movement early when whales start pumping on the news or short the peak. ( I do not recommend shorting unless you know what you are doing. Shorting is way harder then long trading with less potential ROI. )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the price range of the recent DOGE pump on twitter news:\n\n**Doge pumping +162% in a couple days &amp; dumping -52% days after.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6bpl5r815n8a1.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a43ef3bc07c7b8dfe0a7336936e0a50d0ebac1d0\n\n**What about DOGE as investment?**\n\nDOGE is a memecoin and ironically one of the best crypto surviving bear markets. Crypto investors expect DOGE to die every bear market since 2018 yet it's still alive and finds momentum all the time. Chances are high it will probably survive this bear market again and have a chance to increase in value next bullrun **if Memecoins remain interesting for the crypto world**. Doge inflates \\~5 Million DOGE every year something to keep in mind for a long term investment.\n\nI personally shorted the pump. I simply don\u2019t see the point of Twitter actually accepting it any time soon justifying this price. Recession however is around the corner. Even if Twitter makes doge an official platform currency it can still fall back down -50% or more from this pump back to previous level before the news pump it back up again and it holds that level with the news.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yu16eh\/serious_pump_dump_schemes_in_crypto\/","author":"TarkovReddit0r","num_comments":90,"created_utc":1668344819000,"edited":1672236317000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ADVICE","title":"[SERIOUS] Pump &amp; Dump schemes in crypto","distinguished":null,"id":"yu16eh","downs":null,"ups":null}

Basically, FTT tokens could be printed and lent(realistically given) to Alameda, with which Alameda used to post as collateral to borrow against for (free) cash. This could be done over and over. Today, even MORE illicit FTT was issued by the FTT Main Deployer address. Usually, FTT is released at schedules periods. But over early this morning over 100M FTT amount into $400M was released out of schedule. Binance and Huobi blocked deposits of these millions of FTT. Funds are still being tracked at the moment.\n\nThis is another turn in events where insiders used FTX to push a malicious update to FTX apps(and possible website) where they gained access to user accounts and drained their balances. SBF also built a backdoor into FTX accounts and record-keeping such that funds could be manipulated without raising compliance issues.\n\nBasically at this point FTX seems to be full of rats and scumbags who are taking advantage of the situation and trying to take the firm for whatever monetary value it has left.

Your CT\/YT channel is about financial advice and you didn't question how sorts of BlockFi can give 8% yield? You didn't consider lending risk vs the yield?\n\nYou thought that CDC is safe because Matt Damon told you so? You're a financial advice channel and took advice from actors paid to advertise these products?\n\nIf a financial guru misses the obvious red flags, it means at least one of the below:  1. They're peddling you as a product to the highest bidder.  2. They're incompetent and their popularity is a red herring.  3. They're not taking their own financial advice. Weird, ain't it?\n\nI hope that as a result of this CeFi blowout, the blockchain community will finally start to pay attention to the fundamentals and ask the right questions.  Remember, you cannot infect the body that's immune. Let's use this crisis to create herd immunity to snake oil salesmen.\n\nHow do we avoid this happening again in the future?  Simple, the answer was always there, but we didn\u2019t pay enough attention.  DeFi changes everything and is at the helm of the upcoming revolution.\n\nLet's take a look what just happened in the last 24h. \"Crypto .com claims to have \"accidently\" sent user funds was during the Gate proof-of-reserve.  And we just saw similar behavior with Huobi.  Are exchanges passing around ETH loans to pass audits?!\"\n\n\u201cAbsolute power corrupts absolutely.\u201d  Most banks aren\u2019t solvent outside of operating hours for the same reason. They borrow to each other. Your Spaniard gold might be intra-bank lend out to Big Bucks Bank in Hong Kong overnight.\n\nDuring that time Spaniard Gold bank is insolvent. This is banks\u2019 life line. Shall the music stop or other banks deem the borrower to risky the bank has to file to bankruptcy as soon as it opens for business.  It breaks rarely because banks are responsible with their money.\n\nEnter crypto.  Greedy people suddenly enter the same scene and they learn a lot of interesting new legal stuff, for instance technically speaking the money you deposit to CEX isn\u2019t yours. CEX can do with it as it sees fit.\n\nYou start small, $40M investment into politics. Maybe a small loan to a hedge fund with amazing track record such as 3AC or Alameda Research?  All is good, music keeps playing, bull market is charging, every idiot and their cat are making money. Excitement is high.\n\nDo you think only retail was caught up with their pants down?  3AC and Alameda Research turned out to be more degen than a kid with $5 allowance in their mom\u2019s basement.  Why? Lack of morals? Greed? Lack of knowledge and experience? Inability to think 2 steps ahead?\n\nEnter the bear market. Music stops.  \u201cOnly when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked.\u201d \\~ Warren Buffett  Turns out, almost everyone crypto people admired was swimming naked, and naked is to put it mildly.\n\nDo you think the famous Alameda Research is just going to go under? No, the lack of moral backbone and investing intelligence is why they\u2019re here in the first place.  They\u2019ll latch to anything and anyone not to drown.\n\nThey\u2019d just bankrupt and return any remaining funds. But, that\u2019s boring, it\u2019d bring the end to their heroine propelled high status life.  So they latch to anything they can and now the entire pool of people is drowning, not just them.\n\nEnter CEXs. CEXs that played ugly have the same crunch. Do you think people at the top don\u2019t talk to each other? Especially the ones under one bigger group umbrella or the ones in deep shit?  Of course they do. They know they might need to cooperate to survive.\n\nRemember when we mentioned before that banks lend overnight between each other to remain solvent? It\u2019s every overnight. Do you think if banks can pull it off a group of CEXs couldn\u2019t pull it off once?  This hypothesis of lending to show proof of reserves seem very likely to me.\n\nWhat does it mean to CEXs users who use platforms involved in such practices? That someone is literally pulling an Enron on you.  Just as a reminder. Enron was the largest accounting scandal before FTX in history.\n\nEnron looked good on paper by shifting it\u2019s huge hole between legal entities in different countries. The US balance must be audited? Let\u2019s shift our $50B loses to London for a week. London branch must be audited? Let\u2019s shift it back.\n\nWe all learnt from previous crisis. However, what you learnt depends on your moral backbone, so called layer 0.  Some learnt to be careful and increase standards, and that\u2019s ok to fail to avoid being the next Enron.\n\nSome on the other hand learnt that you can do magic tricks with accounting, especially in a crypto, where penalties are lower, or non-existing for certain crimes.\n\nEnter the magic show. Now the music stopped and magicians are down to their last tricks. When will everyone see what they\u2019re doing for what it is?  A simple magic trick.\n\nThe answer is that it might be much sooner than you expect.  People are withdrawing funds and the market is getting worse. That rope certain institutions put around themselves that had 5m radius is now tightly squeezing their necks.\n\n[That\u2019s why they don\u2019t do audits. Audits would catch this. Attestations are meaningless.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/corb555\/status\/1591656147291099136)\n\nRemember not your keys - not your crypto. Don\u2019t wait for CEXs to pull ultimate Enron on you. Either put it in your wallet where it\u2019s truly yours or exchange into fiat and put into your bank account. There\u2019s simply too much risk holding anything on CEXs right now.\n\nSo again, how do we avoid this happening again in the future?

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":0,"selftext":"It is fashionable now to be in favor of regulation in light of the FTX collapse. It's a very small-minded, emotional, childish response. It is a response that does not adhere to first principles of crypto.\n\nNow more than ever we need to be committed to our first principles of not relying on third parties. These first principles have not failed -- rather, they have proven more resilient than ever. That is, being in control of our own assets -- and our keys -- and not relying on third parties.\n\nRegulation is not a panacea. It is not even helpful. It is problematic for the following reasons:\n\n1. Regulation only grows and inevitably goes much too far\n2. It inevitably misses the mark and overlooks many things\n3. It gives people a false sense of security which will result in even MORE victims the next time there is a blow-up\n\nBut the biggest, most obvious reason that we should not support regulation is because **eWE HAVE ALL THE SECURITY WE NEED. THE ONLY REAL SECURITY IS IN THE TECH\/CRYPTOGRAPHY, AND IT IS 100% SECURE.** Not Congress. Not regulators.\n\nWhat we should be supporting instead is education. When people are educated on what crypto is about and what its power is (as outlined above regarding security), only THEN will people truly be protected. This is why education is far far far more powerful than regulation.\n\nIn terms of the objections:\n\n1. \"What about onboarding! What if someone tries to add fiat and in the time between that and the time it's available to trade an exchange goes bankrupt!\"\n\nThis is an extremely rare corner case that simply needs to be chalked up to bad fucking luck. Regulation is WAY worse and would result in WAY more victims for all the reasons I outlined above.\n\n2. \"If we want mass adoption, we need regulation!\"\n\n**NO! The BEST and ONLY way to be as large and powerful of a force as this asset class can be is to remain attached like glue to our first principles of why this asset is so important in the first place.** Anything else is selling out, demonstrates hypocrisy, and will result in the self-demolition of our own industry.\n\nLook, it's not comfortable to think we're really really really on our own here. We want to be wrapped up in a blanket and hugged and told we are safe by the SEC. But here's what you need to realize. The SEC does not give a fuck about you. And just to reassure and remind you: **YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO BE SECURE. THE TECH\/CRYPTOGRAPHY IS THE ONLY REAL 100% SECURITY, AND YOU ARE FULLY IN CONTROL OF IT.** How fucking liberating is that!\n\nWe are the ambassadors of this space and it is our responsibility to be educated, thoughtful, and clear in what we support and why. That is why supporting regulation is wrong and antithetical to who we are, and anyone calling for it now is a coward and a hypocrite, and doesn't realize the true power of cryptocurrency or what the cause is about.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yu4uol\/the_fall_of_ftx_will_not_destroy_cryptocurrency\/","author":"WSox1235","num_comments":89,"created_utc":1668353386000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"PERSPECTIVE","title":"The fall of FTX will not destroy cryptocurrency, but regulation could.

But even without them, the balance of pros and cons between custody VS self-custody has completely changed in the last few years.\n\nWhen I got into crypto a few years back, self-custody wasn't on the menu for me \u2013 my DCA amount was rather small, plus I wanted to get in and out different altcoins. Bitcoin (pre-Lightning) transactions were rather expensive (esp from a CEX!), Ethereum gas costs were insane and most blue-chip alts were ERC-20s. CEFI's\/CEX's offered lucrative APY's. That's why, a centralized exchange was pretty much the only way to crypto. I even remember sending XLM between exchanges to save a few dollars!\n\nFast-forward to now.\n\n**Variety**: there are lots of alternative blockchains and each has its own altcoins and shitcoins. All of them are just as easily  accessible  through DeFi.\n\n**Gas fees**: a uniswap trade on Ethereum mainnet is about $2 (could be less). Bitcoin tx \u2013 5 cents. Layer2 transactions and alternative blockchains are dirt-cheap.\n\n**Infrastructure**: there are functional bridges and DEXes on any blockchain.\n\n**Stacking**: most of the exchanges slashed their APY's, so on-chain staking doesn't look too shabby in comparison.\n\n**Security**: not your keys not your coins never changed. Self-custody with all necessary security measures was, is and will be the safest option.\n\nThe point in favor of using a CEX is probably convenience. That's pretty much it. But how important is conveniece when the tradeoff is the risk to lose everything? IMO now it's just lazy and gross *not* to self-custody.\n\n**TLDR: high Bitcoin and Ethereum gas fees, lack of infrastructure used to push new users to more convenient custodial platforms (which also offered high APY's).

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":125,"selftext":"I saw Coin Bureau and other overoptimistic \"buy high\" crypto influencers are now \"selling low\" and moving to stablecoins. Coin Bureau says he sold his portfolio to nearly 40% USDC.\n\nDO NOT DO THAT. **Sell to fiat if you aren't going to hold through the bear market, but do not buy stable coins.** (edit: DCA'ing in now would be the least stupid way to invest in crypto, of course.) Buying stable coins is the same risk as keeping your crypto on exchanges. Here's why:\n\nNobody has any idea what these custodial stable coin issuers did with their deposits. We know they mostly bought corporate bonds, but we have no idea which ones. Not only is this a serious risk due to the corporate bond market, but there is a much bigger risk here. Every $1 USD deposited into a custodial stable coin is eventually used to buy crypto. But every $1 USD deposit is also used to buy a corporate bond. So right off the bat, these stablecoins are double spending and inflating the buy pressure for corporate bonds.\n\nThat's a problem, but not catastrophic. And for the record, I wouldn't trust anyone a crypto company hired to audit the quality of their assets anyway. Where the real risk lies here is that many of these bonds were probably purchased from crypto industry companies- just like FTX buying Alameda debt. These custodians all have deep ties within crypto. Market makers use stable coins to quickly move in and out of crypto pump and dumps using orderflow data from exchanges. Their business interests are all interconnected and their incentives overlap. \n\nReportedly, the majority of USDT was issued to two companies, and Alameda was the biggest of those companies. That doesn't mean they kept all that USDT, or even prove that Tether is definitely insolvent, but it means that they are very closely connected organizations and probably knew exactly what each other were up to. All of the stablecoins have relationships like this. So here's the real risk people don't talk much about:\n\n**If any significant portion of the bonds these custodian's purchased was indirectly double spent on financing crypto purchases and fueling their partners pumps by doubling the buy demand for crypto, that means that claiming these stable coin deposits will create cascading double spend sell pressure on crypto- even assuming none of these bonds are made worthless because the issuing company is insolvent (an unlikely best case scenario).**\n\nEven indirect investments in the crypto industry will create sell pressure on crypto when those bonds are sold to reclaim the USD deposit, at the same time that depositors (which are mostly the same institutions that buy\/sell this kind of debt) are most likely to need to sell crypto (and debt) to get their stablecoins back to reclaim their fiat deposits and cover their losses. It's entirely possible that all of these stable coins are backed by assets that have already declined in value and will collapse with crypto prices. \n\nIf you want out of crypto, than cash out to fiat currency, but absolutely do not hold stable coins right now. Nevermind that you should have sold last year, buying stables right now could be the most dangerous move you could make. My advice is to either cash out to fiat or stop looking at prices and hodl. Obviously stop using centralized exchanges for anything other than on\/off ramping to\/from crypto.\n\nEdit: reminder that no rational argument has ever followed a comment that says \"FUD!\"\n\nEdit: see u\/blue_moon_army 's [comment](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yudod4\/psa_whatever_you_do_do_not_buy_stable_coins_right\/iwaicbb?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3)  about the attestations of reserve balances that these companies are publishing.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yudod4\/psa_whatever_you_do_do_not_buy_stable_coins_right\/","author":"Awhodothey","num_comments":287,"created_utc":1668372462000,"edited":1668401614000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANALYSIS","title":"PSA: Whatever you do, do not buy stable coins right now.","distinguished":null,"id":"yudod4","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":27,"selftext":"Here are some things I've learned on the basics of crypto wallets, how they work, and how to safely secure your crypto assets. As I am new to the crypto space, I hope this will be helpful for people who are also new like me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you buy crypto on an exchange such as Binance or Coinbase, that crypto you just bought is sitting in wallets owned and controlled by the exchange. **Leaving the crypto you purchased on exchanges expose you to risks such as hacks, scams, bank runs, and possibly all of the above.** FTX is a prime example of this. And a quick google search will show you how often these things occur in the crypto space! This is why you will want to transfer the crypto you purchased off exchanges and into crypto wallets that you own and control.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[What are Crypto Wallets\uff5cExplained for beginners](https:\/\/youtu.be\/d8IBpfs9bf4)\n\n&gt;The **seed phrase**, a set of **12 words** or **24 words**, is the **private key** that unlocks your **crypto wallet**. Coins such as BTC or HBAR in your crypto wallet live on decentralized public ledgers, and the only way to access them is through the seed phrase. The most secure method for storing the seed phrase and accessing assets in your crypto wallet is by using a hardware wallet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore you get a hardware wallet, make sure it supports networks for the coins that you own. If you're not sure which one to choose, I recommend checking out the Ledger Nano S Plus since it supports many major networks and coins. Here are some guides on [how to set up and use a Ledger](https:\/\/youtu.be\/KJ7r82xAEOo). You will also want to know [how to backup, recover, or make duplicate hardware wallets](https:\/\/youtu.be\/avMvJhhrHOY). I recommend you also learn how to use a [passphrase](https:\/\/youtu.be\/DR5SKuhF-50) on top of the seed phrase to create a *\"hidden\"* crypto wallet. [Setting up a passphrase](https:\/\/youtu.be\/D3xIsdtmgck) will create a crypto wallet that can only be accessed if you know both the seed phrase (generated by the hardware wallet) and the passphrase (known only to you). It is extremely important that you know how to [reset, recover and verify your seed phrase](https:\/\/youtu.be\/UfqJI3pt36s) as well as [your passphrase](https:\/\/youtu.be\/cyNJ8dZE8ME). And make sure you understand the [difference between your seed phrase, passphrase, and the pin\/password](https:\/\/youtu.be\/53khH9vDw2I). All of these principles apply no matter which hardware wallet you choose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is strongly recommended that after setting up your crypto wallet, you immediately reset the hardware wallet and **do a recovery using the seed phrase the hardware wallet generated during the set up process**. For the purpose of learning and practice, I recommend you do this using HBAR since it is cheap, fast, and reliable when making transactions. This will allow you to see your transactions completed within a few seconds, which will cost you exactly $0.0001. Here's my process for setting up and verifying that I did everything correctly on my Ledger hardware wallet:\n\n* Set up my Ledger hardware wallet and [create an HBAR account](https:\/\/youtu.be\/A_ElOGlMf2o), then I [deposit 69 HBAR into that account](https:\/\/youtu.be\/1gEzyICLW4g).\n* Then I wipe out the Ledger hardware wallet and **do a recovery using the seed phrase the hardware wallet generated**, which I wrote down on paper from the setup process earlier.\n* Then I reimport the HBAR account back onto the Ledger hardware wallet created earlier.\n* If I see the 69 HBAR deposited earlier and I'm able to move them to another wallet, then I know everything was done correctly.\n* If you create a *\"hidden\"* wallet using a passphrase, deposit 420 HBAR into that and verify it as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce you have completed setting up your crypto wallet and you have verified that you are able to recover that wallet, the next step is to backup the seed phrase you wrote down earlier. **If you lose the seed phrase, you lose that crypto wallet forever.** It's recommended that you create multiple copies of your seed phrase and store them in different geographical locations that only you have access to and know about. Some people choose to [imprint their seed phrase on stainless steel washers](https:\/\/youtu.be\/3Aj_EHOu9WE) or [metal plates](https:\/\/youtu.be\/IAHFB_IQfgc) for protection against fire and water damage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's all the basics for safely setting up, storing, and accessing assets in your crypto wallet. **Remember: if you lose the seed phrase, you lose that crypto wallet forever**.\n\n* Do not take pictures of the seed phrase.\n* Do not store the seed phrase on a computer or online.\n* Do not give the seed phrase to anyone for any reason.\n* Do not enter the seed phrase into any website, app, or software wallet for any reason.\n* If you need to do a wallet recovery, you will enter the seed phrase directly into the physical hardware wallet itself and no where else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote that if you own BTC, [your BTC wallet address will change after each transaction](https:\/\/youtu.be\/IzBxxeGSkIo). And some crypto assets such as Polygon MATIC may live on multiple networks, so [pay close attention to which network you are choosing each time you make a transaction!](https:\/\/youtu.be\/sTnOqaCmSxA)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, here are some related tips about safety while using your wallet. The general ideas presented in these guides for the MetaMask wallet on the Ethereum network also apply to wallets that you might use on other networks.\n\n* [How to Secure Your MetaMask Accounts Using a Ledger Nano Hardware Wallet](https:\/\/youtu.be\/M0sxkVZTAtw)\n* [What are Dusting Attacks &amp; How to Avoid Them?\uff5cExplained for beginners](https:\/\/youtu.be\/_dPkAxRwvew)\n* [MetaMask Security - 9 Attacks and How to Stop Them](https:\/\/youtu.be\/2Yuq9u27O94)\n* [Metamask Security \ud83d\udd12 , Reclaiming Funds &amp; 7 Tips to Prevent a Metamask Hack](https:\/\/youtu.be\/wrXchcFxFjA)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, always practice using your wallet with small amounts when trying something out for the first time. I strongly recommend creating separate wallets for different purposes. I would personally create a wallet for holding the majority of my crypto assets and never use that wallet to interact with anything except for the purpose of sending and receiving. I would also create additional wallets for other purposes such as defi so I can limit losses should I some how mess up or expose one of my crypto wallets to hacks, scams, or theft. And should the theft of your seed phrase occur some how, having a passphrase will buy you critical time to safely move your crypto assets to a new and secure wallet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat if a hardware wallet isn't an option for you at this time? [Then using a mobile wallet on your smartphone is the next best option](https:\/\/youtu.be\/QGKJ_zvzOlU) for securing a small amount of crypto assets.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yui384\/crypto_wallets_how_they_work_and_how_to_safely\/","author":"hashlog5","num_comments":25,"created_utc":1668381412000,"edited":1669234722000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ADVICE","title":"Crypto wallets: how they work and how to safely secure your crypto assets.","distinguished":null,"id":"yui384","downs":null,"ups":null}
{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":13,"selftext":"With all that's been happening in the past few days, I've also seen quite a few questions and some confusion with regards to hardware wallets and their purpose and advantage. I thought I'd clear things up a little by giving a short introduction to them. I tried to keep things simple and not get into nitty-gritty details about everything.\n\nHopefully this helps some people get a better understanding of hardware wallets.\n\n## Custodial vs. Self-custodial wallets\nA **custodial** wallet is where your coins are kept by someone else. An exchange, for example. Your coins are not in a personal wallet, but in a big, common wallet that belongs to the exchange.\n\nA **self-custodial** wallet is a wallet where *you are in control* of your coins. You and only you have the private key that is needed to sign transactions from your wallet. An example of a self-custodial wallet is MetaMask.\n\nThe past few days, it has once again become clear that you should not leave your coins in a custodial (exchange) wallet if you are not actively trading with them. **Self-custodial is the way to go**.\n\nRemember what they say: **not your keys, not your coins**. This is not a meme, but a warning about exactly what happened with funds on FTX.\n\n## A Song of Ice and Fire\nWallets can be hot or cold.\n\n**Hot wallets** are software wallets, such as MetaMask. These wallets are hot, because they reside on internet-connected devices that introduce the possibility of your private key getting compromised.\n\n**Cold wallets** are hardware wallets, such as a Ledger device. They are not connected to the internet. They can be connected to a computer, but your private key stays on the hardware wallet.\n\n## So what's the point of hardware wallet?\n\nHot wallets usually provide more convenience, but there is always a chance that the device you're using is compromised. This is not a chance you should take if you're dealing with a \u2013 for you \u2013 substantial amount of money. They can be used for smaller amounts, of course.\n\nA hardware wallet, such as a Ledger, does two things to protect your coins better than a hot wallet:\n\n* The seed phrase is generated on the hardware wallet itself.\n* You sign transactions on the hardware wallet and the wallet sends the signed transaction back to the application that requested it. The private key used to sign transactions never leaves the hardware wallet.\n\nThese two things mean that a hardware wallet provides additional safety. Not only do you have control over your own coins, but you've also removed the possibility of someone compromising your private key\/seed phrase.\n\nNote that your coins are not actually stored *on* the hardware wallet. The device just grants you access to your coins on the blockchain. You could destroy your device, buy a new one and restore your wallet with your seed phrase.\n\n## Keeping your seed phrase safe\n\nHardware wallets require extra caution with your seed phrase. The point is that your seed phrase *should never come into contact with an internet-connected device*. This means you don't write it on an internet-connected device, **ever**. If you ever (accidentally) write your seed phrase on an internet-connected device, you should consider it compromised.\n\nThere are many ways to store your seed phrase. This can be best researched online. Some people just write it down on paper, others engrave parts of it in metal plates, some add an additional \"25th word\" (passphrase) that they store in a separate place, etc.\n\n## Purchasing a hardware wallet\nA hardware wallet should only be pruchased directly through the manufacturer's website. A device ordered through any other channel could be compromised.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yuigf1\/a_short_introduction_to_hardware_wallets\/","author":"karbonkel1","num_comments":11,"created_utc":1668382278000,"edited":1668383360000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ADVICE","title":"A short introduction to hardware wallets","distinguished":null,"id":"yuigf1","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":37,"selftext":"First, this is obviously stressful anytime FUD creates something like this. The fear is real. As of now, no withdrawals have been stopped, they are just slow.\nThe only negative we have here is they sent a ton of ETH to the wrong whitelisted address and it was all recovered. This was 3 weeks ago.\n\nNow if, they are able to survive this bank run, which is there assets are 1:1 as they say they are, they will. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening:\n\n1. Tons of people are withdrawing. An ETH withdrawal costs roughly $1 if you wait for low gwei, they charge around $5. $4+ Profit off y\u2019all. Every coin withdrawal has markup.\n\n2. CRO is cheap AF, they can load up. CRO isn\u2019t inflationary. They need reserves to pay staking rewards and cash back. \n\n3. Right now, CRO has around a 5% buy\/sell spread. Everyone panic selling and everyone picking up the dip, is putting a few % in their pocket.\n\n4. People are unstaking their card benefits. Right now my $400 jade stake gets me a Netflix subscription, Spotify and 4% back. Thats not including the free airport lounge. That\u2019s a pretty huge cost to them per month for such a small value. (That\u2019s equivalent to roughly 60%apy).\nPeople by the masses are saying goodbye to that for the final 2 months.\n\n5. Lastly, if they make it through this, they were attacked by twitter, withstood the FUD and will look really strong. They will lose a ton of people, but people will come back because they withstood the witch trials.\n\nThat\u2019s a big if, but we don\u2019t have much more than weak speculation to think they are going down and they might just come out laughing.\nStay safe out there but this is night and day different than FTX. One is a mistake, the other is a criminal.\n\nEdit: One final point, if you are just going to mess with the numbers, why reduce the rewards? Reducing the debit card rewards and staking just draws attention. It states that you are planning to a downturn. Why would you do that if your books are crooked? If you were just going to BS your books, I\u2019m pretty sure you would just continue riding the wave. They never did that, they drastically cut to the dismay of customers because they wants to be resilient long term.

Chances are more will fall before the year (or bear cycle) is done. But the implications with bull run market caps, liquidity and volume would\u2019ve been far more catastrophic.\n\nIt almost seems clich\u00e9 to say the bear market is for building, but there\u2019s an element of truth to that.

Well, we have a chance to shape the market for the better. We don\u2019t want the shoddy business dealings of Luna, FTX and the like. So let\u2019s stop putting our faith in these projects.\n\nProjects are starting to show proof of reserves, and this is a good step toward accountability and transparency - let\u2019s keep pushing for more. \n\nWe should set the theme upon which success in the next cycle is founded.

I\u2019d like to see more discussion here about what technologies we need and how businesses should operate, instead of blind faith in chains and tokens we hope to bring a short term return on investment.\n\nThe service we receive is the standard we\u2019re prepared to accept.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":7,"selftext":"I thought I would put this post together in light of what is going on with CEX's and them rushing to post \"proof\" of their reserve assets. This doesn't touch on the possible practice of some CEX's sending funds back and forwards to each other for their \"Reserve snapshots\" to seem like they have more assets on  the books then they usually would, this is a look at what Reserve Assets actually are and what they are really worth.\n\nI'll use Binance as the example because they have recently published their reserves.\n\nOn 10th November 2022, Binance released details of its cold wallet addresses and balance's of the top 6 coins listed on Binance\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBTC - 475,000\n\nETH- 4.9 million\n\nUSDT - 17.6 Billion\n\nUSDC - 601 million\n\nBUSD - 21.7 billion\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll touch very briefly on stable coins.\n\n**Algorithmic Stable Coins:** I think most of us now understand the fallacy that algorithmic stable coins are after the demise of LUNA\/UST... If you don't yet grasp it, the short answer is ALL algorithmic stable coins create a systemic risk event and its not IF but rather WHEN that gets trigger into a catastrophic failure. The reason this happens is that the risk models allow for the 80% and discard the outlier 20% risk events, meaning they have ZERO protection from any of these outlier \"black swan\" events. You could not pay me enough money to hold algorithmic stable coins!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stable coins:** This is a catch all for all the rest of the stable coins. These are as good and stable as the assets that back them and more importantly, the LIQUIDITY of the assets that back them! I'll use Binance's BUSD as an example here because they are at least somewhat transparent as to what is backing it (Though I'm yet to see an independent audit, so its just \"Trust me Bro\" from Binance)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BUSD is 100% backed by reserves held in either or both (i) fiat cash in dedicated omnibus accounts at insured U.S. banks1\u00a0and\/or (ii) U.S. Treasury bills**\u00a0(including through repurchase agreements and\/or money-market funds invested in U.S. Treasury bills).\n\n**BUSD Is** a Binance branded stable coin issued by Paxos Trust Company\n\n[https:\/\/www.binance.com\/en-AU\/feed\/post\/50867](https:\/\/www.binance.com\/en-AU\/feed\/post\/50867)\n\nNow, why are the assets and the liquidity important that back up a stable coin?\n\n**Example:**\n\nA bank run occurs and depositors want their money OUT of Binance. They don't want BUSD, they want FIAT back in their own bank accounts (where the FED can take it from them...) That leaves Binance in the position where in needs to redeem crypto assets for USD $. So that means selling off the assets that back the BUSD to free up USD to then wire out to depositors bank accounts. The types of assets Binance says backs BUSD are:\n\n1 - FIAT cash. This is great, its the most liquid backing asset as it doesn't need to be sold, just moved from bank accounts and sent out to depositors withdrawing to their banks,\n\n2 - US Treasury Bills. Again, another reasonably liquid asset at most times but there have been some issues in the foreign treasury markets recently so its not risk free... But US Treasuries are seen a the gold standard and liquid markets so in most cases having to fire sale a heap isn't going to crash Treasury markets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Getting back to Binance Reserves**\n\nTotal reserves of these 6 makes up $69 billion. Don't get focused on the $ value however. Take BTC and ETH as example's, the $ value that they make up could fluctuate considerably as market price moves up of down. The stable coins are stable as long as they remain pegged....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt has $69 billion in reserves MARKED TO MARKET! Mark to Market is an important concept to understand. Its the snap shot value of the assets based on the market price they were trading at when the snap shot was taken\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say Binance has 1,000,000 BTC on its books as reserves. BTC trading @ $16,200 = $16.2 billion in reserves.\n\nNow, if BTC drops to $10,000, binance still has the 1,000,000 BTC but they are now worth $10 billion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust looking at the $ value of any CEX's reserves is pretty meaningless. What is important is the QUALITY of the reserves. If Binance was holding $69 billion of SHIB as its reserves.... I'd be pretty fuckin worried!\n\nWhat is important when assessing ANY CEX's reserves are these points:\n\n1 - What is the QUALITY of the reserves. Are they majority the CEX's own token (CEL, FTT, BSB and so on) or are they low quality \"shitcoins\". If so, proceed with caution!\n\n2 - What is the QUANTITY of each coin held and what % of total coin issuance does that represent. If the CEX needs to suddenly dump onto the market to free up liquidity, that's going to effect price negatively and the Reserve asset value of that coin is meaningless! If a CEX is holding a large % of a tokens supply, proceed with caution!\n\n3 - How LIQUID is the assets market. Coins with HUGE demand will likely always have buyers willing to buy so dumping a heap suddenly won't completely crash the value. Dump $16 billion of BTC on the market and BTC price will dip hard.... but it will recover. Dump $16 billion of FTT on the market and its price will fall off a cliff and never recover! If a CEX is holding a large % of its Reserves in illiquid coins, proceed with caution!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the CEX has $5 billion of SHIB as its majority Reserves... depositors are cooked in a liquidity event! Would be lucky if that $5 billion of SHIB today is worth $5 million in a fire sale! So the reality is, reserves shouldn't be \"marked to market\" as there reserve valuation, it should be calculated at fire sale valuations because that's when it's going to be getting liquidated!\n\nEven if the CEX carries the \"gold standard\" and holds BTC as its reserve assets.... Come a liquidity crisis, BTC price is taking a beating at least in the short term and CEX's will be forced to sell at the worst time, not the best.\n\nMark to market valuations of CEX reserves aren't worth the screen real estate they take up!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe current $ value of Reserves is only a SMALL part of assessing the financial viability of a CEX, what's more important is WHAT assets make up those Reserve assets that are to be called on to backstop a liquidity crisis! The ONLY thing that matters is how much those Reserves can be sold for in a WORSE CASE scenario.... Because that is their TRUE RESERVE VALUE!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow in the case of a NON-Fractional system. If you deposit 1 ETH, 1 BTC, 1 DOGE into a CEX and that CEX then holds 1 ETH, 1 BTC, 1 DOGE to back your deposit claim... It doesn't matter WHAT happens in the market, what prices do.... If there is a bank run and you withdraw, you're getting back your 1 ETH, 1 BTC, 1 DOGE!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA FRACTIONAL CEX system will always carry liquidity risks.... ALWAYS! Be aware of it at all times and weigh those risks up on a individual level. I still use CEX's but I certainly don't keep all my portfolio on a single CEX or even multiple CEX's! Hot wallets are free to make and it doesn't hurt to have more then you need... Hard wallets are your most secure layer as always though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember, Not your keys.... NOT your coins!","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yuqmnr\/cex_proof_of_reserves_and_what_it_all_means_for\/","author":"Still_Lobster_8428","num_comments":10,"created_utc":1668406058000,"edited":1668406279000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"CEX \"Proof of Reserves\" and what it all means for the lay person.","distinguished":null,"id":"yuqmnr","downs":null,"ups":null}

Thus, the first step to doing that is officially making cryptos labeled a security besides Bitcoin, which eventually, Bitcoin will fall under that category if the government has its way. If we allow the government to put a strong hold grip on crypto then we can say goodbye to decentralization because only a certain amount of people will get to dictate what goes on in the crypto space.\n\nPeople like Kevin O'Leary in my opinion are part of the problem and have only their best interest at heart.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":3,"selftext":"Now we all know that FTX leveraged customers' assets, and right now we estimate that FTX has BTC liability of 84 000 BTC \/ $1.4 billion dollars with a staggering zero BTC on the books to fulfill it's obligations. Below I have attempted to breakdown this whole shit show and what caused this chain of events.\n\nWe know that's common practice that when you deposit money into a bank account, the bank lends your money out to other customers. These customers might want to buy a car, house or other luxuries. Now some banks also allow customers to put collateral to borrow some other asset to trade it. (Herein lies FTX's transgression).\n\n1. FTX allowed customers to borrow things like BTC for cash to make trading bets. That\u2019s all fine and dandy as long as FTX manages risk responsibly (whatever that means) and is transparent with it's customers.\n2. Besides the lack of transparency, a major issue was their behavior regarding FTT, its native crypto token. FTT is like an equity stake in FTX itself, because every so often FTX uses its profits to buy some FTT off the open market (which should increase FTT\u2019s price \/ supply and demand). Customers were allowed to deposit FTT with FTX and use that as collateral to borrow other crypto assets or cash to make trading bets.\n3. This is an awful idea. If the health of FTX is even remotely questioned, then its equity loses value. And if FTX is holding a lot of FTT on behalf of customers who are making trading bets, then that FTT is less valuable collateral, which means that the health of FTX degrades, which means FTT would lose value sets. Bad news like CZ from Binance sending out the Tweet also heavily affected FTT's price, not saying this caused the crash but simply made it worse. \n4. Dodgy dealings,  FTX founder Bankman-Fried secretly moved $10 billion in funds to trading firm Alameda. (EDIT: Added point number 4.)\n\nIf there are any other major points I somehow missed, please add in the comments and I will update the post.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":2,"selftext":" I just came across this Twitter thread and for anyone knowing about Solana, I found it to be a good and worth a read.\n\nThis is not my content, just sharing it here and putting it a an easier readable format.\n\nDue to the FTX\/Alameda situation $SOL has crashed over 50% in the past week and fears have risen that the price of SOLANA, as well as the Solana ecosystem, may never recover. Here is everything you need to know about the situation:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* To be clear, Solana will need to overcome some huge challenges if the ecosystem is going to survive, so let\u2019s start off with a look at what those challenges are. \n* **FUNDING**: Everyone knows that Alameda\/FTX were huge supporters of Solana. As a result, they invested in and advised a large number of projects native to the ecosystem. This is a problem now for two primary reasons. \n* First, any tokens received from investing in those projects will almost certainly be sold off as FTX\/Alameda have declared bankruptcy. Second, any projects holding treasury funds on FTX are now without that funding to continue development. \n* **WRAPPED ASSETS**: Many protocols support wrapped versions of non-native assets such as BTC and ETH to allow for their use on Solana. One of the top providers of those assets, Sollet, held their backing with FTX, meaning those assets are likely now backed by nothing. \n* **SELL PRESSURE**: FTX\/Alameda were massive holders of SOL, with a leaked balance sheet valuing their position at over $1.1 billion. At least some of that position belongs to the massive amounts of SOL we have been watching be unstaked. \n* Whether some of this SOL has already been dumped or not, there is certainly a large amount left to be liquidated. While there is a possibility of it being sold OTC, it is absolutely something to monitor before making any decision to invest or not. \n* **DEFI:** Solana\u2019s defi TVL has decreased by over 50% this week as asset values crashed and users withdrew from protocols amidst the chaos. With defi being a driver of on-chain activity, this is not a good sign. \n* While all of these are serious challenges, there are still some positive factors to be aware of that could help Solana to rebuild and possibly even one day emerge stronger from this incident. \n* The Solana team did not lose their funding. The co-founder confirmed they held no assets on FTX and still have \\~30 months of runway under current conditions. In crypto, 30 months is plenty of time to turn a project around and make some major moves. \n* Prior to this event, Solana had been seeing some impressive growth in several areas. The number of validators is increasing, the chain has 11.5 million active users, network performance has been improved, and the number of devs building there has grown rapidly in 2022. \n* Solana has also been making a name for itself in relation to NFTs, as the chain has grown fairly quickly this year to obtain a large volume of secondary market NFT sales. \n* An interesting factor to consider is that Solana may be better off without FTX\/Alameda once everything settles down, as more and more information is being revealed about just how bad of players they were in the crypto space. \n* Last, and perhaps most importantly is the community. If the ecosystem is going to survive this then users will need to remain active and teams need to keep building. \n* So far, most projects have promised to keep going, but it will be important to watch metrics such as active users and social activity as we progress. \n* **HOWEVER:** The contagion from FTX\/Alameda is not over. We will almost certainly see more companies\/platforms\/projects being revealed as insolvent or missing funds in the coming weeks. As this takes place it will likely affect the price of SOL and the crypto markets in general. \n* With that in mind, if you believe in Solana long term, while you wait for everything to settle down it could be a good time to be doing research into what projects are still devoted to building there and have potential if the ecosystem recovers.\n* Credits:  [@StackerSatoshi](https:\/\/twitter.com\/StackerSatoshi)","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yuv0re\/interesting_thread_addressing_solana_recent_crash\/","author":"callmemrsunshine","num_comments":7,"created_utc":1668421197000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"Interesting thread addressing Solana recent Crash and FUD","distinguished":null,"id":"yuv0re","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":587,"selftext":"At the time of writing SOL is down 60% in the past week and 95% in the past year. If you didn't know, SBF was a very vocal proponent of Solana. He actually went as far as to call Solana literally 'the most underrated token'. Alameda Reearch, a trading firm owned by SBF held around ***10% of the circulating supply*** of SOL in its accounts. A quick rehash of Solana's issues are the very heavy investment and control that VC firms have over Solana as well as their many network outages and heavy centralization.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jas0ohbpswz91.png?width=354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e22f7bb5ef8cc1dbf31678328a3fbe202206c02\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4h9xddbpswz91.png?width=373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5708f54250eea28fea52c9b3b1c1919e4c46c110\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[1W Chart](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/v8hjzf5qswz91.png?width=946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12f4fbd41b0eb7c7309043f16cd4fd8d945113ce)\n\nAlameda Research is now bankrupt and these tokens that they held may be sold off to pay back creditors. Additionally, these are many questions regarding the viability and value of the SOL token as another token that made up a large portion of Alameda's balance sheet, FTT, is mired in scandal as it is very likely to have been used as a tool in very ponzi-like business operations, with Alameda and FTX effectively printing money out of thin air. All of this yields heavy downward pressure on the price of SOL.\n\n Additionally on 10th Nov Solana was meant to release\/unstake a full 63 million SOL to the market as their lock-up\/stake period had ended. This amounted to around 10% of supply. This unlock of 28.5 million SOL *by the Solana Foundation* was postponed due the the FTX\/Alameda collapse and would released two days later. Thus the market was looking at a *potential* iselling of 20% of supply plus whatever SOL holders simply lost faith and decided to sell.

FTT was of course the FTX exchange's token that is used to provide benefits to customers while bringing in extra revenue. Users could, for example, stake FTT tokens in change for lower fees and periodic airdrops depending on the amount staked.\n\nThis is a very common tactic as **almost all** exchanges have a token that they use in a similar mechanism where they hold full control of the token that provides benefits to exchange users in exchange for them staking some amount of the tokens.\n\nNow here is my question. What is stopping any of the exchanges from running this same scheme for free money. Why can't any other exchange simply print tokens freely, lending(giving) it to what is basically a shell company, the shell company borrows against these tokens and gets free money. Rinse and repeat. In my estimate, **nothing.** Nothing is really stopping these other exchanges from doing that. There are some restricting barriers, like period released of these tokens by on-chain deployer contract to limit token creation, but FTX had this and it did absolutely nothing. As a matter of fact, it is more likely than not that other exchanges *have and are* running this same scheme, but it just so happened that FTX was caught first.\n\nThey could do this and we would never know. It was only from an Alameda balance sheet leak through Coindesk that we found out. SBF was too arrogant and showed everyone his cards. But other exchanges and founders are much sneakier and willing to enjoy their spoils in the darkness. We might never find out that the are the real owners of some obtuse shell company secretly funneling ~~millions~~billions.\n\nEDIT: Ironically, a number of other exchanges(like Huobi and a few other obvious names) are *potentially* involved in another of FTX's schemes: Trading with user assets.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yuzmmd\/absolutely_nothing_is_stopping_other_exchanges\/","author":"OneThatNoseOne","num_comments":21,"created_utc":1668433028000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"Absolutely Nothing Is Stopping Other Exchanges From Doing The Same Scheme That Caused FTX To Collapse","distinguished":null,"id":"yuzmmd","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":0,"selftext":"From today\u2019s Bloomberg newsletter:\n\nThe collapse of FTX may accelerate efforts to come up with clearer and stronger crypto regulatory guidelines in the US. You could imagine greater transparency for companies that service the industry. Maybe minimum disclosure requirements for crypto projects listed on centralized exchanges and so on. But on some level it's hard to imagine any of them being effective, for a variety of reasons.\n\nChief among them is the fact that crypto and the regulatory apparatus are like oil and water.\n\nCurrency (fiat currency, that is) is a creature of the law. The law governs what you can do with your money. Who has the money. What constitutes legitimate transactions. When a transaction is deemed illegitimate it can be reversed. When money is acquired illegally, it be be disgorged. Mistakes and errors and hacks happen in the traditional banking system, and then in theory legal authorities step in and clean things up.\n\nBut a cryptocurrency is not a creature of the law. The rules about who can own it, and what constitutes a legitimate transaction are governed by a separate system: the consensus mechanism of a given blockchain.\n\nAnd so any given coin that's held at a regulated entity is essentially governed by two different regulatory entities: the law and the chain.\n\nWe saw this vividly on Friday night, when there were hundreds of millions in unauthorized crypto withdrawals from FTX just hours after the company filed for bankruptcy.\n\nHere you have a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which prescribes rules about who can do what with a company's assets while it goes through a legal restructuring. But then you have someone with access to the corporate's wallets that can just ignore those rules entirely and operate by a separate set of rules: Those of the blockchain. The chain doesn't know anything about Chapter 11. To the chain, those were just normal, rule-abiding transactions.\n\nNow it's possible that the coins can be traced in some way and returned. But it's tricky. And by and large, irreversibility of transactions (settlement finality) is considered to be a feature, not a bug.\n\nSo there are theoretical safeguards that can be put in place to prevent unauthorized transactions and greater security and more transparency and so on. But fundamentally, what a blockchain does is attempt to recreate functions of government, by creating a new, decentralized approach to allocating property rights (Person A owns that. Person B owns this. They both owe debt to Person C). Governments do the same thing. And so the idea of regulated crypto may be an oxymoron, because it makes coins subject to two competing regulatory and legal systems at the same time.\n\nFollow Bloomberg's Joe Weisenthal on Twitter @TheStalwart","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yv0te6\/the_incompatibility_of_crypto_and_regulation\/","author":"Heysteeevo","num_comments":14,"created_utc":1668435696000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANALYSIS","title":"The incompatibility of crypto and regulation","distinguished":null,"id":"yv0te6","downs":null,"ups":null}

We never have and never will compromise on that point. As the crypto ecosystem emerges from infancy into adolescence we are more confident than ever that\u00a0asking for permission, not for forgiveness\u00a0will continue to be the central pillar of how we run our business.\u00a0\n\nIt has been a tough couple of days for our industry. Our hearts go out to all those impacted by recent events at FTX. We are all working together to build a brighter future and moments like these are painful.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt,\u00a0Gemini has no exposure to FTT tokens or Alameda and no material exposure to FTX.Gemini is a Full-Reserve Exchange and CustodianGemini is a full-reserve exchange and custodian. This means that\u00a0all customer funds held on Gemini are held 1:1 and available for withdrawal at any time.\u00a0\n\nGemini holds customer fiat currency in accounts that are segregated from our business, operating, and reserve bank accounts established specifically for the benefit of Gemini customers.\u00a0We do not do anything with your fiat funds unless explicitly authorized and directed to do so by you.\n\nGemini holds customer digital assets in accounts that are segregated from our assets.\u00a0We do not do anything with your digital assets unless explicitly authorized and directed to do so by you.\n\nIn addition to being a full reserve platform, Gemini Trust Company, LLC is a fiduciary and qualified custodian under New York Banking Law and is licensed by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). NYDFS imposes certain excess capital requirements and compliance standards for all assets held on Gemini.\u00a0At any given time, Gemini is required to hold capital in excess of customer deposits and must report any material changes in this capital to its regulator.Gemini is Highly RegulatedSince its inception eight years ago, Gemini has worked with regulatory stakeholders and lawmakers to help shape thoughtful regulation that fosters both consumer protection and innovation. We will continue to do this work. We have spent considerable time applying for and becoming licensed and regulated in various jurisdictions across the world. This is not the easier path (it is expensive and time consuming) but we believe it is the right one.\n\nGemini holds many licenses globally, including a New York trust license, state money transmitter licenses (or the statutory equivalent), an E-Money License from the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK, an E-Money License from the Central Bank of Ireland, and more.\n\nRelated to our licenses, Gemini must undergo annual audits of our financial statements and is subject to bank examinations conducted by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). We are also\u00a0SOC 1 and SOC 2 compliant.\n\nTen years ago, we bought our first bitcoin on Mt. Gox. Those Wild West days informed us with regard to what needed to change. We built Gemini to be this change. We look forward to working with everyone in our industry to continue to build trust in this new magical frontier and unlock its ultimate promise.\n\nOnward and Upward.\n\nCameron and Tyler","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yv8ons\/gemini_is_built_on_trust_safety_and_compliance\/","author":"Clean_Eyes","num_comments":19,"created_utc":1668451659000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"GENERAL-NEWS","title":"Gemini is Built on Trust, Safety, and Compliance","distinguished":null,"id":"yv8ons","downs":null,"ups":null}

It has a fixed supply?  \nBig whoop-de-doo!  \nSo do half the other coins.  \nWhat exactly is your point?\n\nI don\u2019t care that Satoshi Gummymoto made the first jelly beans.  \nWhat makes you think someone else can\u2019t make candy?\n\nSo now what we know their definition of \u201cscarce\u201d hinges on the fact that everything else, that is exactly the same, is not the same as they are, we can start to see how crazy this sounds.\n\nNow lets move on to the fact that they think because they are number 1 now, they will always be.\n\nFirst, can you name 1 thing, that was first invented, that hasn\u2019t changed, that people still think is the best version today?\u2026 I\u2019ll wait.  \nMaybe the wheel. You got me.\n\nBut everything else, certainly every technology, has been improved upon since conception.  \nPhones, cars, houses, roads, spaceships, combs, hats, you can\u2019t name one thing, even then wheel, that has not been improved upon.  \nEven \u201cmoney\u201d or \u201ccurrency\u201d (because I hear you screaming in your head that \u201cbitcoin is not technology its money\u201d) has evolved. From bartering to coins, to paper, to gold standard.\n\nNow, you want us to believe that some \u201canonymous immortal genius\u201d worked out the WHOLE problem their first go around? Whacked out a 9 page whitepaper, and said, \u201cI\u2019ve done it, solved every problem in the world, and no one will ever have to improve on it.\u201dI get you want to believe that, but sit back and think about how that sounds.\n\nIt sounds impossible.\n\nI could go on, and start talking about how they think because they use enough energy to heat their house mining $100 a month that\u2019s its \u201csecure.\u201d\n\nWhat POW is, is a \u201cconsensus algorithm.\u201dA consensus algorithm is a process in computer science used to achieve agreement on a single data value among distributed processes or systems.\"  \nThat\u2019s why it was created.\n\nGuess what dumb dumbs. There is more then one way to do that.  \nWhile lots of coins out there just copied bitcoin, many others didn\u2019t and created their own way to reach an agreement between distributed systems.\n\nThe only reason these guys are still even around, is because bitcoin is still number 1 today.   \nBy far.  \nBut that doesn\u2019t mean shit.   \nThey have been number 1 for a whopping 14 years.   \nWhile that has been 100% of the time since creation, its only been 14 years since creation!\n\nWhat Bitcoin guys want you to believe is that in 100 years, bitcoin will still be number 1.  \nWith all the innovation going on. With the billions of dollars spent on other projects. With the advancement of technology and science, that this alone will be the one thing that needs virtually no improvement.  \nThat without any improvements, at least ones that aren\u2019t strapped on, defeating the whole point to start with, no third party required, it will still be number 1.  \nNot likely.\n\nTo recap, bitcoin is crypto, it\u2019s as scarce as every other fixed coin supply, and it has a consensus algorithm is both slow and wasteful.\n\nIn a decade, or less, bitcoin dominance will subside.   \nIt will be like the novelty it should be.  \nIt will be like owning a Model-T. A collector\u2019s item.\n\nEdit:\n\nA lot of you are saying that \u201cbitcoin\u201d is different then all the other \u201cbad cryptocurrency\u201d and the community wants to separate from other bad actors in the space.\n\nHear is the thing about humans when bad things happen.  \nWe obsess about it. We see potential bad now in everything.\n\nJust because FTX is folding, Do Kwon jumped over the moon,  \nand Sam ran off with your spoon, doesn\u2019t mean good things aren\u2019t happening too.\n\nTheir has been some major adoption recently on polygon, but no one seems to care. I don\u2019t hold any, but big names are coming out with projects, despite the bear market. But everyone is so scared.  \nETH finally went POS. Remined me of when Cardano got smart contracts.  \nSeemed like when it happened, it was just on to the next Elon article.  \nBut these things are happening, and other projects are making attempts to make a real global digital currency.\n\nYou know what being an BTC Maxi is.. its being a god damn Coinist. Saying \"all those other coins are just alike\" is down right coinist. I won't stand for it anymore. Some other coins are good, they are not scams, they are as just and righteous as your btc.  (There is a little sarcasm in there for those how can't pick it up.. but a little truth too) \n\nTLDR: You can't paint everyone else with one brush.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yvd1z3\/bitcoin_is_not_crypto\/","author":"Mirai_MBCG_io","num_comments":48,"created_utc":1668460934000,"edited":1668464954000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"BiTcOiN iS nOt CrYpTo","distinguished":null,"id":"yvd1z3","downs":null,"ups":null}

Given what we know now, it seems like the probability approaches 100% that the people at Alameda were probably not... super concerned about the existence of capital backing their issued stable coins? \n\nFeels like it has to be a massive red flag one of the biggest ponzis in the space was so intensely close to tether.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":3,"selftext":"**TLDR: Had money in Hodlnaut, BlockFi, Celsius, and FTX. Panicked just in time for to get my money out of most of them except for Celsius where I was off by a day having not whitelisted a withdrawal address. Wondering how to view the space going forward.**\n\nThis all started with Terra and UST\/Luna, but since we're kind of talking about CeFi today, I'm going to skip over to the chaos that happened after.\n\nI found this old record of how my crypto portfolio was allocated back in April. The percentages are of net worth, hence being so small. I was a bit all over the place because I wanted to experiment with all the different ways people were promising yield. In hindsight, risks to generate that yield far outweighed the benefit, but at the time I naively thought maybe such things were possible in crypto with \"low risk\".\n\n[Crypto allocation by custodian as &amp;#37; of net worth.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/at0pyeosczz91.png?width=950&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=513bb114e17d9b6983d80208e7d205652d483f0c)\n\nI had a lot on Anchor, but luckily I was able to move most of it out to FTX and even managed to make a bit of money shorting UST on FTX.\n\nHowever, it was clear there would be collateral damage and I started trying to pull my funds off several of the CeFi platforms. The first domino to fall was Celsius. I tried to whitelist a withdrawal address but sadly I was not in time and I ended up with this lovely pair in of emails in my inbox:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/e7lo7eovdzz91.png?width=502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e50012de0e77179994b3a8058c85e9258c707c7\n\nIf I had acted just a day earlier, I could have avoided losing 12% of all my crypto :( Following this incident, I decided not to be slow to act next time rumors were swirling.\n\n* On June 13, I withdrew from Hodlnaut, this represented 8% of all my crypto. Hodlnaut would suspend withdrawals a few weeks later on August 9.\n* On June 14, I withdrew from BlockFi, which represented 10% of all my crypto. BlockFi wouldn't suspend withdrawals till 5 months later with the recent FTX debacle.\n* On Nov 7, I withdraw ETH from FTX representing 16% of all my crypto. I get out just in time with withdrawals halting on the 9th.\n\nI've successfully withdrawn from Binance, and Haru to wait this out. I've also had a fiat withdrawal processed by [crypto.com](https:\/\/crypto.com), though I'm still waiting for the fiat to show in my bank account.\n\n\\---\n\n**What is crypto to you now?**\n\nInitially, I wasn't so much looking for tokens that would moon and make me rich quick, I was intrigued by the yields promised by both CeFi and Defi, I dabbled in both, but thought in general CeFi seemed more convenient until the events following Luna and Celsius.\n\nIt's terrifying to me how much monitoring and staying on top of gossip was required for CeFi, I could easily be down an extra 6 figures if I didn't play it safe with pulling out.\n\nThere's no transparency on the counterparties you are lending to if you consent to lend to collect yield. Even if you're on an exchange not consenting to lend, a shady platform could lend your funds out anyway without compensating you for that risk. It's clear that CeFi in its current state contains much more risk than is justified by the yields promised. I probably won't be using CeFi for more than just an on\/offramp between fiat and crypto for a while.\n\nI know a few people who are using the moment to champion cold storage and just HODLing BTC for years, but this really has little appeal for me. The space is interesting because of experiments and new protocols being built, and you need to interact with these protocols to learn where things are going.  I'm probably going to continue exploring DeFi. Of course, there are plenty of different risks in the space, but I guess I'll just be careful to make sure I only experiment with what I can afford to lose.\n\n**How have recent events changed how you view crypto? Especially with regards to decentralization, transparency, risk, due diligence, and actors in the space. Are you going to stick around? What are you doing going forward?**","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yvdrfm\/my_sour_2022_cefi_experience_dodging_3_withdrawal\/","author":"monodactyl","num_comments":11,"created_utc":1668462601000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"My sour 2022 CeFi experience: Dodging 3 withdrawal suspensions but getting clipped by 1.","distinguished":null,"id":"yvdrfm","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":0,"selftext":"Some CEXes are used with their own apps, some have web interfaces, some offer both. Apps are convenient as they provide better mobility and usability for mobile devices. Compared to web apps, mobile apps are less secure and have less restricted access to devices they are installed to.\n\nAlthough apps are being screened by app stores, it only takes a few hours to approve a new app to store and they are scanned for well-known viruses and malware only. Such automated scans can not detect for targeted attacks, customised ransomware, or extra malicious functionality added by app maker or hacker that will, for example transfers funds from your crypto wallet behind your back hiding its tracks. The same app can spy on your other apps, try to access your banking apps, log key strokes to steal your passwords, redirect your browser to websites for installing more malware. Apps update automatically by default. This means that originally safe and sound app can be turned into malware by pushing a malicious update.\n\nFTX users had the option of using their system with a web browser and installing their app. Both options worked at the same time and provided all the necessary CEX functionality. This means that is was up to users to decide whether they want to trust FTX app and install it, or use the safer website instead and keep their mobile devices clean, private, and safe.\n\nThe risk realised when FTX Support Telegram chat account manager wrote the following message to their telegram channel that FTX General Counsel Ryne Miller pinned: \"**FTX has been hacked. FTX apps are malware. Delete them. Chat is open.  Don't go on FTX site as it might download Trojans.**\"\n\nWith crypto.com the situation is different. Users are forced to install their app because their website does not provide trading functionality. This means that all of their customers are at their mercy and using their app. If the same what happened with FTX should happen with crypto.com app, the results would be catastrophic. Think about it. Crypto.com releases a malicious update, pushes it to their customers, and their app starts siphoning funds on the background, or trading on their behalf, or pumping crypto price, or locks the device and prevents users from accessing and withdrawing their funds.\n\nWhat makes that possible is that the app is controlled by a single entity. There are not other companies or external project members screening changing and verifying the code.\n\nUnfortunately open source does not solve this issue either. For example Binance has their own Trust Wallet crypto app. Because Binance has 100% control of the company who is making it, they control the app and they can do whatever they want with it. The only security open source provides in this case is that the project can be forked and a new app started in case Binance starts to use it in undesirable ways.\n\nWe have grown to trust apps so much that we don't realise the security risks anymore. It does not really matter was the FTX hacking message real or a hoax, time will tell that. But what matters is that the same could happen anytime with any app. And sooner or later it will happen. Compromising the device you are using for handling and storing your money with a CEX app might not be smart. It is as insecure as keeping your assets in a CEX, in any CEX.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yvmj1u\/what_makes_cryptocom_more_risky_than_ftx_was_one\/","author":"2globalnomads","num_comments":26,"created_utc":1668485742000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"TECHNOLOGY","title":"What makes crypto.com more risky than FTX was one week ago?","distinguished":null,"id":"yvmj1u","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":6,"selftext":"There's a lot that's been said in the last two weeks about where Crypto is headed, where it is now, and what the fall of FTX and the ongoing fallout means for the space as a whole. In all of this there's a few points that I've seen repeated that are just kind of wrong, and a few more that aren't being mentioned much if at all, so here's my thoughts on them in no particular order, I hope it's informational:\n\n## Blockchain FTW... or not\n\nI've seen a few people say that FTX being outed is a win for Blockchain and the transparency it provides. The problem with this narrative is that the initial disclosure that led to CZ's tweet about dumping FTT and everything that followed after didn't come from on-chain evidence, it came from much more old-fashioned journalism, specifically at Coindesk, who were able to view an internal financial document that showed that FTX and Alameda were basically propping each other up in mid-air with nothing under them. Source: [https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2022\/11\/02\/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet\/](https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2022\/11\/02\/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet\/)\n\nI'm not going to say that on-chain evidence had no uses here, but it wasn't the source of the smoking gun, and the fact that FTX could transfer so many tokens to Alameda without anyone noticing or sounding any alarms shows the limits of purely on-chain analysis and auditing.\n\n## Yay\/Booo CZ?\n\nCZ is coming out of this in an interesting place. On the one hand, tweeting about dumping FTT would have earned him a pretty immediate visit from the FTC, the SEC, or possibly even the FBI if he were in the US. On the other he's setting up a fund to bail out a bunch of projects, and his company hasn't been shown to be a complete house of cards that's just fleecing its customers and doesn't actually have any assets... yet.\n\nSo about that \"not located in the US\" thing. It's been pretty widely reported and documented, but not it seems widely circulated, that Binance doesn't actually have a clear parent entity for its various regional companies. (source [https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/markets\/2020\/05\/08\/binance-doesnt-have-a-headquarters-because-bitcoin-doesnt-says-ceo\/](https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/markets\/2020\/05\/08\/binance-doesnt-have-a-headquarters-because-bitcoin-doesnt-says-ceo\/)) This is, to put it mildly, shady as hell. I can't think of a good reason for it except to avoid regulations and disclosures that would be required if he actually had an \"HQ\" somewhere. Those disclosures would likely provide a lot of transparency to investors and customers, so if nothing is wrong and nothing bad is going on why hide things?\n\n## Crypto Bailouts and impossible returns\n\nLastly the various crypto bailouts. We've been through this once before with FTX bailing out a bunch of companies in the wake of the Terra\/Luna crash. I get the excitement here, but fundamentally what Binance is doing is propping up their business. If it becomes clear that these businesses aren't actually self-supporting without the literally fictional investment returns business like Terra\/Luna and [Alameda Research](https:\/\/www.cryptoglobe.com\/latest\/2022\/11\/sbfs-alameda-research-under-scrutiny-for-promising-a-15-return-with-no-risk\/) were claiming to provide then they're not really viable businesses.\n\nSo why prop them up? Because it props up the price of crypto overall and keeps letting Binance make money off of it, and off its user base, very probably by betting against them in investments.\n\n## Healthy Skepticism\n\nThe Crypto space needs to spend less time dismissing its critics as ignorant and more time listening to them if it wants to actually outgrow the constant scams and fraud. Coffeezilla on Youtube [called out SBF 6 months ago for excitedly describing what was basically a Ponzi scheme](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=C6nAxiym9oc) which should have been a massive \"oh my god run away\" red flag, but no one in crypto seems to have cared. People say things, every time this happens, like \"I wish someone had caught this sooner\" but every time someone *did* but they were critical of Crypto in general and therefore were dismissed as ignorant of the \"reality\" of Crypto.\n\nI'm not saying start listening to every scare-monger out there, but given that the community has so far failed to cultivate its own actual hardcore skeptics it makes sense to look at the track records of some of these people outside the space and look at what they're saying.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yvoc9y\/a_few_points_on_the_state_of_crypto_given_the\/","author":"AvatarOfMomus","num_comments":5,"created_utc":1668491412000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"A few points on the state of Crypto given the past two weeks","distinguished":null,"id":"yvoc9y","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":538,"selftext":"All-Hands meeting:\n\n\nAt the all hands meeting, Caroline revealed the truth. A little over a year ago, FTX started spending a lot of money. Various investing shell companies set up w\/ FTX or Alameda names were created, some known most unknown, that invested in various illiquid assets that no one in the firm or FTX knew about. FTX Ventures was a large money sink. These various illiquid assets were also money sinks. I think one of the investments was like 1bb on a crypto mining company that went bankrupt? Alameda had also bought out Binance's stake in FTX for ~1-2bb.\n\n\nFTX was buying luxury apartments in the Bahamas, building an office in the Bahamas and then currently in the middle of building a newer, costlier office that would be in the shape of an F. Stadium naming rights, advertisements, endorsements also aren't cheap. It's important to note that at this point in time, none of the user funds had been touched and this had all come from mainly from Alameda loaning FTX money and being given FTT as collateral. Alameda was able to loan so much money to FTX partly because they just had a lot of money, but also because they had many loans themsevles from lenders such as Genesis. Getting loans at that time was generally pretty easy. There is where the hole in the balance sheet came from. Around 6 months ago, \n\n\nLUNA crashed to 0, sending reverberations across the crypto world as they wiped out -800bb in market value. Alameda didn't actually lose much money directly from Luna crashing, in fact they were probably net short at the time of the crash. However, the Luna crash caused many firms to become liquidated, the most notable one being 3 Arrows Capital(3AC). 3AC had taken out a ton of loans(see point above about loans being easy to get), and 3AC defaulting caused a lot of these loaners to go bankrupt. This event created what is known as the \"credit crunch\". In the credit crunch, many loaners suddenly recalled all of their loans just to see who was still liquid. Alameda lost a lot from giving out loans to firms who defaulted. Alameda was\n\n\n\nnow also on the hook for money they didn't have, since they had given a lot of the loan money to FTX or had lost it loaning to now bankrupt counterparties. SBF had two choices at this point, let Alameda get liquidated or send user money from FTX to ensure Alameda's survival. As you read online, SBF chose the latter. From this point onwards, it was just a ticking time bomb before the truth was found out and both FTX and Alameda liquidated. No one at FTX or Alameda knew how much was spent and that FTX user funds had been used to save Alameda All the credit crunch did was expedite how quickly FTX\/Alameda's frivolous spending would be found out.\n\n\n Caroline painted Alameda and FTX getting liquidated as a likely event rather than a tail event(which would've been helpful to know before they hired me...). It was also revealed at this time that Binance had stepped away from their deal to acquire FTX, citing that the hole in the balance sheet was too big to fill.\n\n- - this is a repost from twitter, I found this here - https:\/\/twitter.com\/WhaleChart\/status\/1592408565402464259?t=YiAq7QENCDes8UBZ_48OiQ&amp;s=19 - -\n\n**The legitimacy of this document is definitely questionable but I shared it anyways**","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yvq3lg\/according_to_an_insider_ceo_of_alameda_explained\/","author":"64_squares","num_comments":273,"created_utc":1668497577000,"edited":1668518515000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"GENERAL-NEWS","title":"According to an insider , CEO of alameda explained how they lost it all","distinguished":null,"id":"yvq3lg","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":3,"selftext":"The past week was a rollercoaster with the FTX scandal, rumors of CDC going bankrupt, and there are signs that there might be more to come. The positive side of lurking on this subreddit is that you might notice something early, such as reading about an exchange becoming insolvent so that you can withdraw your coins before they are gone. I feel the sense of community is strong at those times, as we are all in the same boat and have invested (small bits or lots) in crypto.\n\nHowever, the amount of factually incorrect information posted here last week was huge. It's one thing to speculate\/discuss possible problems, but it's quite another to bring forth arguments that can be easily disproved just by a quick Google search on the definition. We cannot do audits ourselves and in the meantime, we have to wait, so it's fine to discuss eventual outcomes.\n\nAn example of a misconception that was posted 1000 times here is the meaning of a cryptocurrency exchange's reserves. Last week some exchanges have posted snapshots of their reserves, which show which coins the exchanges hold in their wallets. Common posts\/threads here were, among other things, 'Why did exchange X invest 18% in DOGE?\", \"Why is my BTC backed by SHIBA?\" and \"What happens to exchange Y if the value of AVAX drops by 50%?\". Posts like these seem often accompanied by some form of panic, as people would probably have expected these balance sheets to contain more blue chip cryptocurrencys, fewer altcoins, more stablecoins and even fiat\/other assets.\n\nEspecially with the proof of reserves\/liabilities coming up, which will evidently be posted here, it seems important to understand what they actually mean, so you can correctly draw your conclusions about them and also aid in the discussion without needlessly spreading uncertainty and misinformation. There is a lot of information on Google, but a quick search leads to the definition below:\n\n&gt;**Proof of reserves (PoR) are independent audits by third parties that aim to provide transparency and evidence that a custodian holds the assets it claims to own on behalf of its clients.**\n\nThis implies that when you see a lot of coin X on a (audited) reserve sheet, clients of the exchange have apparently stored a lot of coin X on the exchange. For every coin a client holds on an exchange, the client needs to be able to withdraw this coin at any time. If 20% of clients hold ETH on the exchange, but only 5% of ETH is stored in the exchanges' storage, your exchange has probably used your funds for other activities. The same holds for **proof of liabilities**, where it shows how much assets an exchange owes to other parties, such as you as a customer. A quick search will educate you in no time!","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yvr5n2\/with_the_upcoming_audit_reports_if_you_want_to\/","author":"delplaya8000","num_comments":10,"created_utc":1668501487000,"edited":1668502028000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ADVICE","title":"With the upcoming audit reports, if you want to join in the discussion, please understand what words like backing\/assets\/liabilities actually mean.","distinguished":null,"id":"yvr5n2","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":396,"selftext":"Simply put, there has been a lot of FUD surrounding exchanges since the FTX collapse, with a majority seemingly targeting Crypto.com (CDC). This post will hopefully clarify the more common FUD.\n\nAs always DYOR and validate any information from third parties.\n\nMost of the FUD can be addressed in two steps:\n\n1. Visit [status.crypto.com](https:\/\/status.crypto.com\/) to view any system outages. When people claim \"CDC have stopped withdrawals\", its easy to check if that's true.\n2. Watch the recent [AMA](https:\/\/youtu.be\/SQeqdR_nbNY) where the [CEO Kris Marzalek](https:\/\/twitter.com\/kris) publicly addresses concerns regarding recent events.\n\nHere's a quick summary:\n\n\"CDC have 20% of their reserves in SHIB, isn't that a shitcoin?\" [(CDC proof of reserves)](https:\/\/portfolio.nansen.ai\/dashboard\/crypto.com)\n\nWell yes, these are what the users have bought. CDC is an exchange that holds its users funds 1:1 in a reserve. That means if you, the user, buys SHIB they actually store the exact amount of SHIB for you. How crazy is that? (Looking at you FTX) [Kris's Response](https:\/\/twitter.com\/kris\/status\/1591213769841311744) and in the [AMA](https:\/\/youtu.be\/SQeqdR_nbNY?t=893).\n\n\"CDC had $1b of users funds in FTX!\"\n\nFalse. Over 2022, CDC transferred a cumulative amount totalling $1B between CDC and FTX. At the time of FTX collapse, CDC only had $10m on the exchange. Kris addresses that [here](https:\/\/twitter.com\/kris\/status\/1591928306097868800) and in the [AMA](https:\/\/youtu.be\/SQeqdR_nbNY?t=1169).\n\n\"CDC cant afford the hundreds of millions in partnership and sponsorship agreements!\"\n\nTake the Crypto.com arena deal worth $700M over 20 years as an example. They don't pay the full amount upfront, rather they pay a small amount every year for 20 years. ($700m\/20years = $35m per year estimated). CDC's brand awareness campaigns totals less than 10% of its [annual revenue](https:\/\/twitter.com\/kris\/status\/1590990837588332546), which exceeded $1b for 2021 &amp; 2022. Kris also discusses this in the [AMA](https:\/\/youtu.be\/SQeqdR_nbNY?t=1663). They are also major sponsors of the Qatar 2022 world cup, which will have an estimated reach of over 5 billion people.\n\n\"CDC transferred over 320k ETH to the incorrect wallet!\"\n\nThis is true. Although funds were not lost, they were simply transferred to another whitelisted wallet owned and in control by CDC. Kris address's that in the [AMA](https:\/\/youtu.be\/SQeqdR_nbNY?t=2084) and in [this](https:\/\/twitter.com\/kris\/status\/1591741801245052928?cxt=HHwWgMDQ1YOvgJcsAAAA) twitter post.\n\nCrypto.com [will be releasing](https:\/\/twitter.com\/kris\/status\/1591036634283540480?cxt=HHwWgIDUsfTYv5QsAAAA) their full audited proof of reserves in the coming weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Not your keys, Not your Crypto.**","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yvr8zi\/clearing_the_waters_around_cryptocom\/","author":"DoctorKizza","num_comments":382,"created_utc":1668501845000,"edited":1668501993000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"EXCHANGES","title":"Clearing the waters around Crypto.com","distinguished":null,"id":"yvr8zi","downs":null,"ups":null}

DCA more when the market is in fear, DCA less when in greed.\n\n\\- For the meme I also DCA a bit into DOGE... :)\n\n\\- ADJUSTMENT-\n\nI have started to buy the dip a bit more aggressively. As we come deeper in the Bear market I decided it was time to push my average cost down a bit more. Also once I have started to buy a coin in the top five I keep DCA into it. I stop when they exit the top 10 excluding stable coins.\n\nNow to update where do I stand and what are the results up till now\n\nSo to measure performance, I will look at what this strategy has done compared to a lump sum investment at my starting point on the 15th of December.\n\nUPDATE\n\nMust admit I had FOMO...made a gamble on Luna....probably a stupid one.....I'll keep it and take it as a lesson learned.....Stick to the F$#@%$\\* plan!!!\n\nI have adjusted my strategy a bit.

When pump postpone DCA in bear market.\n\nUPDATE 7-10-2022\n\nStarting to look like a very good time to accumulate. Still wondering if there is going to be another drop. Hold off on DCA this week, due to unemployment rates release in the US today and FOMC minutes next week.\n\nUPDATE 29-10-2022\n\nAs Elon bought Twitter I acquired some additional DOGE....Small bet hoping to pay off.\n\nSo as you all can see some have worked out better then the others.\n\nBut IMO it is very interesting that we are in a downtrend combined with this strategy.\n\nWill try to keep you all updated once in a while on how it is performing.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yvu1ki\/rekt_by_sbf_my_journey_into_crypto\/","author":"rbepe","num_comments":54,"created_utc":1668510472000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"STRATEGY","title":"REKT by SBF - My Journey into crypto","distinguished":null,"id":"yvu1ki","downs":null,"ups":null}

They were labelled as FUD, Binance plants and crypto haters. Then FTX failed. Several months before that, posts and comments about Celsius being a scam received negativity. Then Celsius fell. Barely a few weeks before that posts and comments just *questioning* Terra\/Luna not being a Ponzi was met with pushback.  Terra soon crashed.\n\nI am not saying any and all concerns or criticism is correct. But it is good to have conversations questioning things. At this point a lot of this sub have dissolved into something very similar to the SafeMoon and its blind faith. Every criticism or concern is called FUD. They even have a FUD flair.\n\nWe come to today where people are questioning Crypto.com reserves. Having concerns about Kucoin and OKX. Querying activities about Huobi and Gate io. And it's being labelled FUD. \n\nLet me be clear once again: **Nobody here wants to see crypto fail**\n\nI understand people are jaded and crypto is taking a lot of heat. Some people here probably introduced coins to your family and friends. Honestly, that one is one you. Some of us maybe based our whole lives around crypto and maybe depend on it to put food on the table.Unfortunate maybe, but that's also on you.  I am actually in both camps and that's on me. Everyone here knew crypto is volatile. It was always a risk. Major risk with major rewards.\n\nBut: **No one here wants to see crypto fail**\n\nAll we want is a crypto without scammers and scumbags who rip off unaware retail customers. We want a crypto we can trust with our own money and perhaps one day our family and kids future. Any firm that *does* act fraudulently, we *do* want *them* to fail. It is better for bad firms to fail now that later when they are even larger and will cause way more losses. If imagine the 2008 version of crypto. You should know the whole world economy didn't collapse to the ground only because banks were bailed out, and crypto is definitely not gonna get bailed out, so everything would collapse close to 0 from which crypto may never recover.\n\nDo you really prefer to see that happen *in the future?* Or to see just a number of firms collapse *now* and crypto eventually recover much stronger.\n\nStop calling valid concerns.

I even warned about it on Reddit multiple times and got flamed, also lost a bit because I had stocks in Mirror. Why? I'm a former stock market addict. We did expect some fairness from American's owned FTX, as Vitalik said.\n\nThe first problem of the modern machine we live in today. Viral marketing. Powerful people with money create armies of blind followers that perpetuate their BS and actually defend their ground. Look at the Safemoon army. Those guys are spitting poop. I actually own some of it, once it was $3000, now 172 dollars. Defending brands is the same, in a way.\n\nFTX had a huge marketing and influencer machine that gave us a sense of security. People talk about Huobi going bust, have you actually used Huobi chain or Mdex? They were good places to be, they had substance. FTX didn't have its own network, for instance, just marketing. Oh, and the hype, and the fake amphetamine fueled brains living off the past. Yea, those guys running FTX. (just mentioned Huobi, I don't have funds there anymore for a long time)\n\nThe second and more important problem is that FTX reflects the whole corruption around the \"suits\", the global corporate and stock market. The one that enslavens most of us, and fools a lot of people into getting in and financing obscene salaries for the usual Ivy League privileged people, that usually are not that brilliant anymore, even though they were once.\n\nIt's not just a problem of privilege and nepotism. It's a problem of corruption, close ties, insider information, shielding from the law and eventually, destruction of companies, families, , lives, society and the whole economy. Believe me, if you're between 30-40, you'll see these guys wrecking everything until you die.\n\nI'm not here to change anything. I just had to say it. And hopefully have some people wake up from their blind marketing efforts and hopefully turning some of you against the \"system\". The \"system\", as I frequently say, is not a machine. The system is made of people, that is riding jets and eating caviar, while exchanging insider info and not expecting ever to go to jail for mishandling or appropriating the ants money. They also generally don't care about total destruction.\n\nI won't start on politics.\n\nmy 2 cents","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yvwnup\/the_bigger_problem_is_not_ftx_itself\/","author":"classified_x","num_comments":17,"created_utc":1668517511000,"edited":1668518005000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANECDOTAL","title":"The bigger problem is not FTX itself","distinguished":null,"id":"yvwnup","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":0,"selftext":"One thing that fascinated me during the FTX collapse is that I could not figure out why people take such extreme risks. It might just be me, but if I am running a multi-billion dollar exchange making eight figures every day *just in exchange fees*, I would never be risking my clients\u2019 assets or taking unnecessary leverage.\n\nThis [thread](https:\/\/twitter.com\/breakingthemark\/status\/1591114381508558849?t=M4TywlFJlPqLD47WU4iP4w&amp;s=08) from my friend Matt gives an in-depth look into the psyche of SBF that made him take crazy bets. Here we can look into the thread [SBF himself made in 2020](https:\/\/twitter.com\/SBF_FTX\/status\/1337250686870831107). It talks about his thought process behind making bets. The question he is asking here is: **how much would you bet if you had $100K and you win only 10% of the time?** *(If you win, you would get 10,000x of your bet)*.\n\n[SBF\u2019s risk tolerance is far outside what\u2019s normal.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/u7900hvq840a1.png?width=647&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e99d8f5803ee4df3d4e0505bff3d3db6ba474df7)\n\nKelly criterion is a formula that\u2019s used to calculate the optimal size of a bet when the expected returns are known *(*[*optimal bet sizing using Kelly Criterion*](https:\/\/marketsentiment.substack.com\/p\/invest-like-a-gambler)*)*. For the above thought experiment, if you use Kelly\u2019s formula we get the bet size of \\~$10K. **This is the maximum that you should bet** given the low probability of success.\n\nBut SBF goes much farther - for him the optimal bet is 5x this amount. Why? He says he wants to solve the key problems in the world and their scale is huge. **A noble but misguided thought process.**\n\n[Solving world problems by betting customer deposits](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/scf4qmoz840a1.png?width=657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5970242949a057e03b99d079ae8e1c389cf9ec3a)\n\nFinally, he concludes by saying that you should be taking a significant chance (aka risk) if you want to create a significant impact.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/fngo6qo1940a1.png?width=659&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e43d824306e873e442ab8b30d144c4eaeb5df015\n\nIn the end, Matt [shows him](https:\/\/twitter.com\/breakingthemark\/status\/1591114451675410433) that betting more than the amount recommended by Kelly is extremely risky and SBF just says ***\u201cwe have to agree to disagree\u201d.***\n\nIf SBF\u2019s plan was to maximize the benefit to the world, he should have just risked **his own money**. That way if he wins big, we would all benefit but if he ends up losing it all, the impact on others would be minimal.

For me, I\u2019ve been thinking through rules that may help me evaluate alt coins in the future.\n\nA couple ideas I\u2019ve been thinking of.\n\n1) Coin remains in the top 100 through multiple bear and bull markets.\n\n2) Coin has a more even distribution of owners. Ownership isn\u2019t concentrated in the hands of a few (say what happened with SBF and Solana\/FTT, etc.) that can crash the price on a whim.\n\n3) Coin has perfect or near perfect uptime.\n\n4) Coin lacks a central figurehead that wields too much power. Take Do Kwon with Luna. BTC stands out to me because the creator remains anonymous. This feels like a benefit, so that your charismatic and corrupt Elizabeth Holmes\/Do Kwon\/SBF types stay on the sidelines.\n\n5) Strength of the community (Reddit followers, tweets, daily transactions, etc.)\n\n6) Clear use case now. Not the promise of some fancy protocol that may or may not be developed in the future. But a clear use case in the present moment, be it privacy, store of value, remittances, etc.\n\n7) Lack of VC\/institutional investment. How grassroots is the project? Did growth happen organically? Or did the creators manufacture growth with a huge VC budget? I generally distrust advertising. I see ads now for coins all the time. Yet, I never see a BTC logo inside a baseball or basketball stadium.\n\n8) Tokenomics.\n\nWhat other criteria do you use?

Let's say, a situation similar to FTX happened to Binance as well. I am not saying it would happen to Binance, but one thing that FTX has taught us is that no one is too big to fail in crypto. \n\nSo, let's say Binance goes down. Obviously, BNB would lose a significant portion of its value. But maybe it might remain strong because it has a use case outside of Binance the CEX. I'd also expect that a lot of tokens on the BNB smart chain ecosystem would lose value (e.g CAKE, BIFI, TWT, etc). Maybe BUSD might depeg as well.\n\nWhat about tokens that are not native to the BNB ecosystem? For example, ETH or BTC stored on the BNB Smart Chain.

Squawk Live is hosted by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Joe Kernen and while initially, the questioning was pretty fair and just open fair questioning that did not last very long. The initial questioning led Sen. Lummis to promote her bipartisan bill with Sen. Gillibrand that's purpose is to try and take some of the Wild West nature out of the crypto space. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt did not last long though as cohost Andrew Sorkin jumped on Fidelity offering some clients being ability to own Bitcoin in their 401k. Mr. Sorkin pointed out that when Fidelity announced the program Bitcoin was around $28,000 and now it is at $16,500 and how big of a loss that could be to someone's 401k. When the questioning started to devolve at this time I have to tip my hat to how Sen. Lummis handled the situation. Her responses were to the point and had actual substance behind them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor instance, she pointed out that Fidelity is going to hold Bitcoin reserves to back up what is in someone's account. FTX did not own Bitcoin and has no Bitcoin which naturally is an enormous issue! During this intense questioning cohost, Joe Kernen was quick to jump in and point out to Sorkin that a 401k is not a place to day trade and when you look at stocks like Meta have performed even worse losing 66% of its value compared to Bitcoin being down 63%. Sen. Lummis continued on this track saying Bitcoin is a long-term investment something that you are holding for years and years so short-term movements should not be the focus of people. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last thing that she mentioned that I think was spot on was that this is not something that can be rushed. Legislation needs to be done in the way it was meant to be and take its time to go through hearings and reach the point that a good piece of legislation is reached and not a knee-jerk reaction piece of legislation. Based on these comments the groundwork is being laid for crypto legislation to come in 2023 under the new Congress.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yw155a\/sen_lummis_on_squawk_live\/","author":"Status_Floor1746","num_comments":9,"created_utc":1668527763000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"GENERAL-NEWS","title":"Sen.

It\u2019s a shame critical discussion is silenced here. \n\nIn light of recent events I am going to start writing up risks I see in various crypto exchanges and companies so you all can be better informed. \n\nTo be clear, I do not think you should store your wealth on ANY exchange. We need to self regulate if regulations won\u2019t protect us then knowledge is key. Binance will be next depending on how this goes, they share many problems in this list. \n\nCryptoCom has some serious issues in my view. Here is my list of problems.\n\nThe MCO-CRO token debacle and their original card program. \n\nTheir lending program which somehow avoided all contagion from the Celsius, Voyager, hodl scenario. How? \n\nEarn program allowing CRO to be used as collateral which would allow the company to borrow user deposits\n\nTheir earn program has had higher rates than industry norms and has long lockups. It is also a security (packing and offering yield is a security)\n\nHow did they accidentally send 85% of their ETH reserve to a competitor? Why do they need to hedge user purchases? Are they counterpartying user trading? (This means they are selling tokens they don\u2019t own on exchange) \n\nThey have job listings for quant traders suggesting further they are trading against customers. This is illegal in securities markets in US because the incentives are perverse\n\nIs CRO on the balance sheet and is that how they\u2019ve padded the books to finance all that marketing spending they\u2019ve done? (Arena name, superbowl ad, f1 sponsorship, etc) over 1B spent where did the money come from?\n\nTheir revenue from trading fees do not support that kind of spending. They said they had over 1B revenue, how much of that came from selling CRO to retail users? Their trading fees\/volume don\u2019t come anywhere near 1B revenues, even in bull market. \n\nThis is just my shortlist of potential issues and why I worry about their longevity. Now to be clear again I don\u2019t think you should leave your crypto on ANY exchanges. Many exchanges have these exact same problems. Buy your coins and get out. \n\nIf you disagree with some things here let me know but don\u2019t just angrily downvote.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":5,"selftext":"Browser wallets have long been discouraged in this sub, but I think the risks are blown way out of proportion. Here are some myths about browser\/mobile wallets like Metamask, Coinbase, and Rainbow wallet:\n\n1. *It's not safe to connect my wallet to websites*: connecting won't do anything other than give some basic information about your account. You approve every transaction or signature you make with the website after connecting, that is when funds can be at risk, not the connection itself.\n2. *Signing messages is not safe*: This used to be more true, there was a type of message you can sign that allowed transactions to be made on your behalf. This standard fell out of practice and most wallets will be very clear (with warnings and red text) when you are interacting with this old standard. The new standard of signatures can not make transactions for you.\n3. *My funds can be hacked because the wallet is connected to the internet*: This isn't true in and of itself. No one is going to magically hack your tokens unless they have complete control of your phone or computer, and then you probably have bigger problems. Your funds are at risk if you either give away your seed phrase (like to a fake support agent or fake wallet app), or approve a transaction that does so.\n\nBasically A) Never share your seed phrase B) Only use reputable defi websites and double check the URL C) Read everything you approve D) Be extra careful any time restoring your wallet, and you will be fine.\n\nAlso, if you just want to use the wallet for storage and not interact with any websites, it's almost impossible for you to get hacked! You can even delete the application from your browser\/phone and keep the seed phrase or PK safe, then \\*carefully\\* restore it on the proper application when you want access to your funds again. The restoration is the part where you are at some risk, since an attack vector is duplicate false applications, but a little double checking and you'll be fine.\n\nI say all of this because I see so many people here who are scared to move funds from an exchange to a wallet, and after the events of this week and celsius, IMHO you are way more at risk on a centralized exchange than a browser\/mobile wallet. But the zeitgeist here is a bit anti-hot-wallets (which is sort of not a great name for them), which discourages people from moving their funds off of exchanges. I think this sort of parroted mantra probably discouraged some redditors using FTX to keep their crypto on there rather than bother with a hardware wallet.\n\nAnd of course, as I'm sure many are ready to reply right now, \\*a hardware wallet is your safest option\\*.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":24,"selftext":"Fortunately, I\u2019ve been so busy over the last year or so that I never got around to checking FTX out. I do, however, hold some of my crypto in CDC and so this week was quite tumultuous to say the least.\n\nNeedless to say, I have a lot of feelings about things that happened. Here they are:\n\n- I do not believe Binance (and CZ) are a force for good for crypto.\n\nHonestly, I doubt CZ cares that much about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. \n\nSure, he sees it\u2019s potential \u2014 but his actions in the last couple of weeks feel like nothing more than a self-serving power grab. Tbh?\n\nHis actions were those of a greedy despot who\u2019s desperate to monopolise a new market with a lot of untapped potential.\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m wrong, but it will take a lot to change my opinion now. Still\u2026 I\u2019m currently in the process of exiting the Binance ecosystem altogether.\n\n- It\u2019s time we super duper regulate Binance.\n\nTo be perfectly clear, this doesn\u2019t mean we have to super duper regulate crypto. \n\nHowever, Binance (and CZ) really do require oversight\u2026 and frankly? \n\nI think regulators should forcefully break up the Binance empire. I\u2019m not necessarily anti-centralisation. I think centralisation has its place in crypto, but too much centralisation concentrates power in the hands of only a few (CZ) and creates a house of cards.\n\n- CZ needs to stop tweeting (maybe sued?).\n\nI\u2019m all for free speech, but his Twitter feed qualifies as market manipulation.\n\nEven if we assume CZ had the best intentions for crypto and its early adopters, publicly disparaging the competition smells of \u201crot.\u201d\n\n- I feel better about keeping my crypto on CDC.\n\nAn exchange\/platform that survives a \u201cbank run\u201d is one that I feel I can trust.\n\nI\u2019m, honestly, not surprised though.\n\nCDC charges the highest fees, has the widest spreads, and costs the most to withdraw crypto from. We hate it for all that. However, CDC more than any other CEX, can justify its business model with actual fees.\n\n- Crypto investors must accept that centralised exchanges operate more like banks than exchanges.\n\nIf a CEX, whether it be Celsius, Voyager, FTX, or even Binance, offers really attractive APY\/APRs then it\u2019s probably more of a bank than an exchange. How else can it pay you this interest \u2014 WITHOUT leveraging your crypto?! \n\nIf a CEX is leveraging your crypto, then a \u201cbank run\u201d will most likely kill it \u2014 regardless of the overall health of the business.\n\nIf everyone walked into the Bank of America tomorrow to withdraw their fiat, the Bank of America will collapse. Nearly all banks rely on fractional reserves (~15-20%) and it\u2019s the same with crypto exchanges.\n\nShould it be this way?\n\nAbsolutely not. If you promote your service as an exchange, that\u2019s what it should be. It shouldn\u2019t be a bank in all but name.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ywcbpu\/ive_been_in_crypto_for_a_long_time_but_this_week\/","author":"TheFamousHesham","num_comments":51,"created_utc":1668553001000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"I\u2019ve Been In Crypto For A Long Time, But This Week Taught Me A Lot\u2026","distinguished":null,"id":"ywcbpu","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":5,"selftext":"  In the wake of the greatest loss of user funds in crypto history, we are bound to hear renewed calls for tight regulation of the crypto space. Not only that, it is very normal for people who take an anti-regulatory stance to be dismissed out of hand. \n\n  How, critics argue, could you possibly argue against the regulation of a space that seems, from the outside, to be nothing more than an endless string of scams and hacks? How could you possibly defend that?  Those who express concern about crypto regulation are ridiculed as either petty criminals or delusional libertarians, but the reality is much more nuanced.\n\n  The answer comes down to what regulation actually looks like, and how the government actually behaves in applying its regulatory weight.  It comes down to where you think the government fits on a spectrum, which at one end has \u201cThe government is a benevolent and disinterested overseer of markets, whose job is to mediate the diverse interests of market participants\u201d and at the other has \u201cThe government acts like a singular market participant pursuing its own particular interests at the expense of all else\u201d.  I lean strongly towards the latter, and I\u2019ll explain why.\n\nThe 2017 ICO boom created very few lasting projects.  99% of 2017 ICOs failed, and this is perhaps the unsurprising consequence of the fact that anyone who launched a token and a website at peak euphoria could pretty much print 7 figures of free money out of thin air.\n\nBut among all the garbage, scams and misdirection, there were some absolutely top tier projects in there.  A diligent retail investor doing fundamentals investing could have bought into projects like ATOM and LINK at close to their lowest ever historical valuation, and barely paying more than any private seed round that occurred beforehand.\n\nThis was, sadly, the historical high point of retail access to early investing opportunities in crypto.  It\u2019s rarely discussed just how much worse things have gotten since then, or why.  A fundamentals based retail investor in 2022 could find a dozen high quality projects (I have) and what is striking is that *you literally can\u2019t invest in them if you tried*.  They are all closed seed rounds, VCs only, angel investors only.\n\nAnd this is a direct consequence of the SEC shutting down ICOs under the auspices of \u201cconsumer protection\u201d.  Let me restate this to be very clear.  You currently CAN\u2019T invest in early stage, high potential crypto projects, but rich insiders and VCs can, and this is ostensibly to protect you.\n\nThe government, while saying it was stamping out the exploitative practices of the ICO mania, has passed the ability to invest at ground level to rich insiders.  This is not the benevolent mediation of a market, this is insider profiteering at the expense of the rest of us.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just limited to ICOs. Why doesn\u2019t Uniswap, the second most profitable protocol in crypto, share any fees with holders? How can GMX share profits with holders?  Because Uniswap founders are doxxed, and if they share fees with holders they risk scrutiny from the SEC. GMX, being anonymous, is somewhat protected from this. Again, let me restate this in very simple terms. We, as UNI token holders, are *not allowed* to share in the profits of that protocol, because of regulation. Consumer protection from what? From earning money? From making it?\n\n  It keeps going, why did American citizens miss out on tens of thousands dollars worth of airdrops that happened last year? Because they were prohibited from using the platforms that would have made them eligible. Why? Well, consumer protection of course.\n\n  It\u2019s the same story over and over again.  That **every single active government regulatory intervention into crypto has been a way to rip off end users like you and me for the benefit of privileged insiders**, all while dressing itself in the language of \u201cconsumer protection\u201d.\n\n And now with the FTX collapse we have possibly the most egregious, barefaced, shameless example of this in crypto\u2019s history. That \u201cour man in Washington\u201d, who wanted the strictest regulations put up behind him, and excluding his company uniquely, was the most brazen and shameless scammer crypto has ever seen.  If any of us tried 1\/100th of what he did we would be in jail. \n\n  I don\u2019t want regulation in crypto for the simple fact that the government has not demonstrated, even once, that it actually has the interests of the broader market at heart.  Zero clarity, retrospective regulation by enforcement, zero consistency.  They arrested the TornadoCash dev and still hold him without charge, while SBF, who stated on twitter that he had $1 billion in liquid funds THE DAY before FTX.US declared Bankruptcy, still hasn\u2019t been arrested.  Actually, arrested is an understatement, he just got a softball article from the New York Times framing this whole thing in his words as a big, sad accident.\n\nHow anyone, that actually knows what is going on, could possibly conclude that *more* government interference is the solution to these issues, is beyond me.  If the government wanted the credibility to intervene they would literally need to do everything the complete opposite to what they are doing now, at the very least beginning with the arrest and prosecution of SBF and a very large apology from the SEC and Gensler about how they allowed such a snake oil salesman into their inner sanctum.\n\nBut we don\u2019t see any of that, and until I see any sort of indication of the government acting like, you know, a government, and not a very small band of self-interested scammers, it\u2019s hard to imagine that this will change.\n\ntl;dr reading is good for you, dude, gets the brain going","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ywfi52\/why_i_am_strongly_against_crypto_regulation\/","author":"Phallic","num_comments":25,"created_utc":1668561343000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"REGULATIONS","title":"Why I am strongly against crypto regulation.","distinguished":null,"id":"ywfi52","downs":null,"ups":null}

I firmly believe that he has ulterior motives for talking publicly in a time, im sure, his lawyers have told him to keep his mouth shut.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ywgja9\/sbfs_deleted_tweets\/","author":"Brobeast","num_comments":8,"created_utc":1668564184000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"SBF's \"deleted\" tweets?","distinguished":null,"id":"ywgja9","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":21,"selftext":"Hi all \u2122 \n\nSBF made a series of Tweets today expanding on his original cryptic thread where he spelled the word HAPPENED over a series of a couple days. He eventually continued that thread with some real posts focusing on what went wrong, the situation today, and his plans going forward.\n\nBy and large this was mostly the same fluff he's been posting since early on:\n\n* FTX was caught in \"liquidity crunch\"\n* He's looking for investors to save the operation (ZERO CHANCE AT THIS POINT)\n* Says sorry but avoids directly addressing how or why customer assets were lent to Alameda\n* Does not expand on how Alameda managed to lose:\n   * All their money (billions)\n   * All of the money invested into FTX (billions)\n   * All of FTX customers' money (many billions)\n* **States that FTX has $9B in assets vs. $8B in liabilities**\n\nI've made a video where I go into detail on how the $9B in assets demonstrate the fraud that SBF was running. There is no way he believes his own bullshit. Operating an exchange like FTX which trades in derivatives, allows crypto collateral etc. requires very complex risk management systems. \n\nVideo here: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8wCE6IivZaw](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8wCE6IivZaw)\n\nIn this case, FTX is listing assets like SRM, a shitcoin they launched themselves.  The market cap of SRM on Coingecko is \\~$100M.  FTX meanwhile lists their SRM coins as an asset worth $2.1B.  SBF is still quoting this balance sheet value today when he's talking numbers, as if this is a real asset.  Think about this, he is listing their SRM position as being 21X the entire global market for the SRM coin.\n\nI believe he is getting this number by taking today's price and multiplying it by their total allocation of future SRM unlocks \/ vesting.  Meaning, by the time all the SRM tokens are minted, FTX will own about 7.5 Billion SRM. Implying that newly minted tokens will somehow retain their value as the supply is increased by a factor of 30.\n\nSam knows this is bullshit. I can prove it.  Check this Twitter thread from October where he discusses the exploit on Mango Markets:\n\n[https:\/\/twitter.com\/SBF\\_FTX\/status\/1580170215304089600](https:\/\/twitter.com\/SBF_FTX\/status\/1580170215304089600)\n\n[https:\/\/twitter.com\/SBF\\_FTX\/status\/1580170232546570242](https:\/\/twitter.com\/SBF_FTX\/status\/1580170232546570242)\n\n[https:\/\/twitter.com\/SBF\\_FTX\/status\/1580170250343284736](https:\/\/twitter.com\/SBF_FTX\/status\/1580170250343284736)\n\nSam describes the risk engine at FTX as \" ***probably the most important thing we do at FTX. \"***\n\nThis guy built an empire on shitcoins. He absolutely knows the balance sheet entries for SRM, MAPS and others are complete bullshit. Once again, they are marking their holdings as being 20X larger than the entire market cap for each project. They refer to these tokens as being \"semi-illiquid\". In reality, these assets are worthless. $MAPS has a $5M market cap.  It's listed as $600M on the FTX balance sheet.  Over 100X...\n\nAt this point, SBF is trying to make it appear like an honest mistake. His goal right now is not to save FTX. His goal is to save his ass from a jail cell. Everything he says, everything he does, is an attempt to obfuscate intent and responsibility. They are trying to build a story that they just took too much risk. But that is not what happened.\n\nThey committed fraud. They would never accept these asset values from a counterparty. In DEFI, what they did would be considered an exploit. It's similar to pumping a shitcoin on a lending platform, depositing it, and withdrawing all the collateral. They've just done it on a massive scale, on their own exchange.\n\nWhat would we call it if someone came to AAVE, deposited 7.5 Billion SRM (20X the circulating supply) and used it to borrow $1B in assets? We'd call it an exploit. These guys used an exploit on their own customers to try and bail out their shitty crypto hedge fund. Now it's all blown up and they're trying to play the victim.\n\nDon't let them off the hook. Criminal charges must arrive. These people need to be hauled to prison ASAP.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ywpikb\/ftx_accounting_fraud_in_depth_look\/","author":"chuck_portis","num_comments":11,"created_utc":1668592915000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"FTX Accounting Fraud - In Depth Look","distinguished":null,"id":"ywpikb","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":5,"selftext":"SBF's Alameda received the largest issuance of USDT of any firm, receiving a collective 37% of *all* USDT supply. Regarding USDT issuance, the Tron network(owned by Sun) received $37B USDT, the largest of any network by far. The ETH network, the second-largest receiver, only received $32B. Tron network actually holds 55% of all the USDT issuance.\n\nSun's DAO Tron in February named SBF's Alameda Research a whitelisted institution permitting Alameda the rights to mint and the right to burn USDD as well as act as advisor and recommender to the network. So in the end, SBF had full control of USDD AND FTT as well as received loads of USDT.\n\nNow after FTX halted withdrawals, SBF and FTX offered a credit facility to allow users to withdraw but *only* using one or more of the Sun-owned tokens tokens namely BTT, TRX, SUN, JST and HT. Regarding HT(Huobi token), Justin Sun bought a undisclosed stake in Huobi, which could be as high as 100%. Sun admitted to holding 'millions in Huobi tokens'. SBF was also rumoured to be involved in the deal\/acquisition.\n\nThe Tron-FTX credit facility lead to Sun-owned tokens on FTX gaining a markup of up to 4000% over the market price. Sun likely made a killing from the deal as Sun-owned token deposits were blocked and while there were about $9B locked up on FTX, Sun only injected liquidity of $13M, hence the huge markup. So Sun would could pump his tokens in to FTX, sell for he markups and of course he could withdraw his profits while essentially no one else could. I [made a post about this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ys98ze\/justin_sun_and_sbf_are_allegedly_absolutely\/) previously.\n\nNow days ago, Justin Sun bought $1B in USDT when the peg broke and it fell to $0.97. He claimed that this was \u201csafeguard the overall blockchain industry and crypto market\u201d. More likely it was to safeguard his own assets and bottom line. And perhaps those of his 'partners'.\n\nHuobi also recently reported as not being able to withdraw 18M from FTX, 13M of which was customers' assets. Why were customer funds on FTX? There's no good reason. FTX themselves were also almost certainly caught trading with customer funds. The hole only gets deeper. And then of course, Tether were issuing USDT that weren't backed by collateral\/USD although Tether said it was. All three involved in some degree of customer deception and fraud.\n\nThere are some clear and deep connections between these three. One rat has been caught and we will see the other come scampering out as the pyramid threatens to collapse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\n[https:\/\/www.binance.com\/en\/feed\/post\/51451](https:\/\/www.binance.com\/en\/feed\/post\/51451)\n\n[https:\/\/tether.to\/en\/transparency\/](https:\/\/tether.to\/en\/transparency\/)\n\n[https:\/\/www.bnnbloomberg.ca\/crypto-s-justin-sun-says-he-owns-tens-of-millions-huobi-tokens-1.1832337](https:\/\/www.bnnbloomberg.ca\/crypto-s-justin-sun-says-he-owns-tens-of-millions-huobi-tokens-1.1832337)\n\n[https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/huobi-co-founder-reportedly-looks-to-sell-majority-stake-valued-at-over-1b](https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/huobi-co-founder-reportedly-looks-to-sell-majority-stake-valued-at-over-1b)\n\n[https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/145865\/tron-dao-reserve-launches-usdd-on-over-seven-dexs-and-names-first-member-and-whitelisted-institution](https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/145865\/tron-dao-reserve-launches-usdd-on-over-seven-dexs-and-names-first-member-and-whitelisted-institution)","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ywu5gl\/the_dirty_sbf_tether_and_justin_sun_pyramid_of\/","author":"OneThatNoseOne","num_comments":12,"created_utc":1668607213000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANALYSIS","title":"The Dirty SBF, Tether, and Justin Sun Pyramid of Partnership Schemes","distinguished":null,"id":"ywu5gl","downs":null,"ups":null}

He can instead commit to buying up the TRX that is stuck there at a price floor of 20 cents on the dollar (in line with the premium it was trading after the announcement) and commit to holding it until the end of the bankruptcy process. Other projects can commit to something similar, they have a lot to gain and little to lose.\n\nFor arbitrage traders, this is a wet dream and if I didn't already have money stuck in the exchange, I would definitely buy in.\n\nFor creditors, at worst it doesn't make a difference. As long as you don't allow any company in the bankruptcy process to use P2P to cash out, the total liabilities and assets would stay the same they would have been otherwise, except for the fees earned. There could be some measures in process to prevent money laundering, but it's all between KYC'd accounts. And vetting which coins are allowed to participate could prevent market manipulation on more illiquid coins in case it's a concern.\n\nWe would just need users that want to participate to agree their debt would be represented by the tokens they hold in the account rather than the balances they had at the time trading stopped.\n\nDue to price discovery, FTX can try to raise liquidity, improve transparency, etc., and if the market believes in what they are doing, it's possible that the discount closes and once people are willing to trade the assets close to their market value, FTX is a prime target for purchase. Or it could keep doing what it's doing, slowly reintroduce other forms of trading and eventually reopen withdrawals.\n\nTo clarify, I'm not saying FTX can completely reimburse customers' deposits, or that they can survive as an exchange. I'm just trying to prevent value destruction. These measures would save part of the brand value and allow people to control their risk exposure, asset exposure, and liquidity needs in a way that suits them. For practical purposes, this is precisely raising liquidity for users, but much faster, more efficient, and decentralized.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ywvxcw\/how_ftx_could_instantly_get_liquidity_for_its\/","author":"ComprehensiveCrab50","num_comments":66,"created_utc":1668611330000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"EXCHANGES","title":"How FTX could instantly get liquidity for its users and possibly save itself","distinguished":null,"id":"ywvxcw","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":0,"selftext":"Look, it's an absolute dumpster fire out there right now. The community is wondering where we go from here. What does the future look like?\n\nLet's start with a fully decentralized and non-regulated crypto system. Well it looks like $1,000 BTC, or less, but who cares because 1 BTC = 1 BTC. People using Bitcoin as a P2P form of payment and the government staying out of it all. Mainstream media stops reporting on BTC and it's hard to even pin down a price because it's the centralized exchanges that allow for the trading of BTC\/USD that sets the price in USD. Cool.\n\nIf the above is what you want then hats off to you, you still embody the original ideals of BTC. You can stop reading here.\n\nHow about people who see BTC and crypto as a new asset class and want to make money. I am definitely in this group and I think a large portion of this sub is. So why can't you have your cake and eat it too? Because the above scenario where the government stays out of things means the price of BTC relative to the USD plummets. Idealists don't care (remember 1 BTC= 1 BTC), but for the rest of us we need regulation, we need safety nets, we need user friendly options, otherwise BTC can't thrive and the coveted mass adoption never happens. If you think BTC is going to take over the world and end up being the reserve currency, rendering USD obsolete. Put down the Michael Saylor punch and stop reading here. That's not happening.\n\nThe only way BTC continues to increase in price is if it can merge with the current financial system. I'll lose some of you here, the people who want crypto to replace the current system. But come on, that isn't happening either. Be realistic here, we need spot BTC being traded on the NYSE, we need strong regulations to protect against what just happened with FTX (Celcius, LUNA), we need people who are 50+ comfortable with the idea of investing. We need regulation! Or the making of USDs off crypto is dead and crypto will remain an oddity that will be written about in textbooks 20 years from now.\n\nTLDR: The BTC network is fully decentralized and that's awesome, but all the peripherals around it need to be centralized and regulated. That's the only way BTC as an investment doesn't die and we all make money.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":87,"selftext":"So I'm really tired of hearing about crypto lenders going bankrupt. Celsius, 3 Arrows, Blockfi, FTX, and now Genesis is on the brink.  It makes zero sense, lending is literally the easiest way to make money.\n\nNow, I've dabbled in DeFi.  I've also gotten loans from banks.  In traditional finance, whenever the loan was greater than 1 month's salary, I had to collateralize it.  In DeFi, it's always collateralized.  When the value of the collateral reaches a certain threshold, you get liquidated\/margin called.  The ensures the lender doesn't lose money.\n\nNow typically, the collateral value is greater than the loan value.  The lender will likely profit when you get liquidated.  Additionally, the lender gains a yield from the interest of the loan.  And even more, they can earn a spread on your deposits- they can offer a 4% USDC deposit rate, but lend USDC out at 6% and make the easiest 2% ever.\n\nLiterally all crypto lenders need to do to not go bankrupt is to liquidate positions or perform margin calls when they approach being upside down.  It takes like, 2-3 people who know how to code to automate this function. There's github repos that have the shit already coded, just need to make a few tweaks.\n\nYet somehow, these degenerates still figure out a way to completely fuck it up.  The only two explanations are they are literally running a Bernie Madoff ponzi and running off with customer funds the second they are deposited, or they are giving out massive uncollateralized loans.\n\nSo, if you're hell bent on earning a yield through lending (only for the experienced and high risk takers), PLEASE do it through a DeFi protocol that is set up to not be completely degenerate with your funds. \\*WARNING- The protocol can still be hacked and you lose everything. Beware\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR- Crypto lenders have millions of ways to make money and prevent losses. All the bankrupt companies literally just decided to steal money or had the dumbest business practices ever.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yxg2gv\/how_the_actual_fuck_do_crypto_lenders_go_bankrupt\/","author":"002timmy","num_comments":139,"created_utc":1668658096000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"How the actual fuck do crypto lenders go bankrupt?","distinguished":null,"id":"yxg2gv","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":52,"selftext":"####**Intro**\n\n[UC Podcast's latest episode](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ghnPRkREBRM) was an incredibly-dense discussion by a panel of crypto experts and insiders (from Dragonfly and Gauntlet) about what happened.\n\nIt's a 2-hour episode, and **this summary is already the TL;DW**. I'm not going to shorten it any more, you lazy fucks. It took me 2 hours of listening and 1 hour of writing to compile this 5-minute summary. It covers more than the dozens of other news reports combined. This is the best insider details you'll get before the Netflix documentary.\n\n####**Key points**:\n\n**SBF had a backdoor into FTX's book-keeping system** (11:00-12:00): He could execute orders\/transfers that would not alerts auditors or internal employees. [Secondary source](https:\/\/fortune.com\/2022\/11\/16\/sbf-dangerous-decision-making-philosophy-brought-down-ftx-investing-leadership-behavior-gleb-tsipursky\/). He used this to secretly transfer funds between Alameda and FTX.\n\n**SBF's pump-and-collateralize strategy that he used over 30 times** (15:30-21:30)\n\n* The traditional pump-dump strategy for ICOs was to create a coin, pump it, and then dump it. The downside is that you could only do this once, and if you're caught, you get into massive trouble.\n* SBF's strategy was to create a coin, pump it, and then collateralize it. He did this ~35 times\n* These shitcoins (e.g. FTT, SRM, APT, and 30 others you've never heard of) were on multi-year hyperinflationary schedule with an extremely small liquidity at the beginning. They were designed so that staking rewards were massive in the beginning, leading to many early investors rushing to get into them. This lead to a giant pump.\n* They were taking loans based on the value of these tokens early on before the early stakers would begin selling their tokens. Eventually, supply inflation and staking rewards would produce more selling pressure. The tokens were meant to lose value over time, but gradually enough that they could acquire those loans to make more.\n* All CeFi companies were giving loans based on the value of these pumped FTX shitcoins. It was similar to the subprime loan situation, but worse. With subprime loans, both the lender and the borrower lose during default. With shitcoin-collateralized loans, only the lender would lose out.\n* For CeFi companies, there were only a few originating customers borrowing loans: mainly Alameda and 3AC. When 3AC went down, the CeFi companies could only turn to Alameda Research. And that's why they stuck with them.\n* CeFi companies misled their retail customers about their collateralized loans because the value of their collateral from FTX\/Alameda kept going down over time. If they liquidated Alameda by regularly adjusting their loan-to-value as should've been doing, they would lose their only borrowing customer. Without their borrowing customer, retail customers would get no interest and would leave.\n\n**Why the scheme failed in the long run** (21:30): Due to collateral, they needed to keep the value of their shitcoins and FTT up above a certain value. For FTT, this was $22. When no one wanted to buy FTT anymore, FTX\/Alameda had to buy it themselves at a loss. We know this because CEO Caroline Ellison Tweeted this offer, and because they kept FTT right above this critical level for half a year. Otherwise, loan liquidations would start, and the scheme would collapse like a house of cards. (The podcast doesn't mention it here, but that made SBF's model a Ponzi scheme. It could not run forever.)\n\n**Alameda's insider connections with FTX** (23:00-25:00): Alameda was buying up FTX shitcoins before they were listed on FTX. They had insider knowledge about supply circulation and manipulate it together. Projects had to partner with Alameda in order to be listed on FTX.\n\n**FTX did not have a CFO or a board.** (26:45-30:00): They paid their employees poorly and churned through employees. It was controlled by an inner circle of 4 core members (in a polyamorous relationship) at their retreat in the Bahamas. There was massive divided between what the inner circle knew and what the rest of the employees knew.\n\n**VCs that invested in FTX ignored basic auditing and failed at risk management** (35:30-38:00): Many  giant traditional VC investors (e.g. Blackrock, Sequoia, Coinbase Co-Founder's Paradigm) in FTX never required financial basics with FTX. One of the VCs that did due diligence, Chamath Palihapitiya of Social Capital, asked for FTX to get auditors from the big 4 and board members, and SBF told him to fuck off.\n\n**Hasseb of Dragonfly reveals his own story** (37:45-39:00): about how Dragonfly walked away from a deal with SBF back when he was head of Alameda because they Sam was shady because he kept changing the deal. SBF avoided Dragonfly afterwards.\n\n**Discussion about SBF's combined system as a Ponzi Scheme** (59:45 - 101:00:30): If Alameda and FTX were run completely separately, it wouldn't have been a Ponzi. But they worked together to manipulate the price of FTT and had to keep it above a certain value for as long as they could to remain stable. They used FTT as collateral to borrow more. Once the price of FTT fell below that level, loans liquidated and it all collapsed like a house of cards.\n\n**One reason for lack of auditing** (105:00:00 - 106:00:00): FTX grew during the pandemic. VCs and auditors could not do full audits by visiting offices. It was all over online meetings.\n\n**Sam has greatly set back the Effective Altruism movement** (110:00 - 114:00)\n\nThere's also this written article, [FTX Collapse Explained](https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/learn\/ftx-collapse-explained\/), which I'm pretty sure is based on this podcast episode since a lot of the wording is copied, and it was published afterwards.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yxgqqn\/serious_unchained_podcast_a_panel_of_crypto\/","author":"Maleficent_Plankton","num_comments":18,"created_utc":1668660089000,"edited":1668696496000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANALYSIS","title":"[SERIOUS] Unchained Podcast - A panel of crypto insiders\/experts break how SBF Fraud's machine worked and why no one caught it months before","distinguished":null,"id":"yxgqqn","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":0,"selftext":"I have been around the blockchain world since 2017 and joined at the peak of the bull run in August. Back then, I joined Steem, which is a site for writers, readers, developers, and more. That site later hard-forked to form Hive and a second hard-fork for Blurt. Anyway, I wanted to talk about 2017 and 2018 in specific.\n\nSo, I was on Steem, and we used to conduct project reviews for new tokens, exchanges, or token launches. What that meant was we used to read up on the project through the material available on the net. However, more or less, all new projects had only their site to give details of the project. In that sense, we were reading through them and more or less judging and forming opinions about the project.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/e7vr770jag0a1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81c4b89a818f3043cd012f7ff43981e761cc586c\n\nNow talking specifically about the exchanges launched around that time, the well-known issue of smaller and newer exchanges failing was due to a lack of liquidity. That meant a new exchange could be launched, but it wouldn't have enough liquidity for all the tokens and coins for traders. So, you could end up in a situation where the trade won\u2019t go through, or there won\u2019t be a trade in the first place. The novel idea to deal with this situation back then was for most smaller exchanges to tie up with larger exchanges to provide liquidity. \n\nSo, all new exchanges came up with a collaboration with a bigger exchange that would back them should they run out of liquidity. This worked wonders for traders\u2019 trust in the exchange, and most of them got going in that manner. Multi-country, multi-token exchanges came up that way. Needless to say, they would probably interact with the bigger exchange through the bigger exchange\u2019s tokens. For example, Binance was the biggest exchange back then, and when it was providing liquidity to smaller exchanges, the transactions or liquidity cost would be covered in BNB (This was not the only way but one possibility). Why are we going through all this? \n\nFast forward to 2022 - the USP of 2018 has become a bane in 2022. Back then, the thought was that only the smaller exchanges could fall, so the bigger one was assumed to be alright. But now, we are seeing the reverse. Bigger exchanges like FTX are failing, and therefore, smaller exchanges depending on them or having substantial exposure to them would fail too. As an example, think FTX \u2013 Gemini. \n\nTrust me, this is a new learning in the crypto world. One USP of 2018 is a curse in 2022. This only goes to show that the bigger player can also fail, and smaller exchanges have to come up with a better survival plan going forward. \n\n***How this information helps you? If you know, such linked exchanges take out your crypto to your wallet from such exchanges before you get news of their fall.*** \n\nDon't wait for the news. ***Be careful!***\n\n\\-----------\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*--------------\n\nImage Courtesy: [Guaxipo](https:\/\/pixabay.com\/images\/id-3375234\/) on Pixabay\n\n\\-----------\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*--------------\n\n\\*\\*Disclaimer:\\*\\* This is absolutely what you think.

Found it!               \n\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/ysx8k2\/if_theres_ever_a_place_i_could_be_that_im_not\/                   \n\nSo there's a couple of questions to ask here:                  \n1. Are you legally liable for giving an unpaid review of FTX as a platform with your honest opinions?  and...               \n2. If you're like Kevin o' Leary and thought there was nothing wrong with the platform and openly stated endorsement for the platform, are you legally liable for endorsing it - assuming you didn't lose money there?               \n\nThere is a caveat to all of this. If I'm not mistaken, Kevin was never a U.S. citizen - he's Canadian. He's a citizen of the UAE now, if I'm not mistaken - according to wikipedia, which cites an interview he gave on CNBC. I'm not sure if this means he is a dual citizen however, and if this relieves him of responsibility. He also lost money on FTX, though I'm not sure how much he lost.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yxng1u\/are_there_liabilities_for_people_and_youtubers\/","author":"sgtslaughterTV","num_comments":9,"created_utc":1668683187000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"Are there liabilities for People and YouTubers who make UNPAID \/ NON-SPONSORED videos or public endorsements for a project or cryptocurrency company that fails?","distinguished":null,"id":"yxng1u","downs":null,"ups":null}

If not those two, then I hope this FTX insanity should do it for you. \n\nMaybe it's the fear of responsibility that keeps people from self-custody, maybe it's the uncertainty of how to use it, or the self-doubt, but after this massive financial collapse, people who were once afraid will at least try. It really isn't that complicated, you just have to be disciplined and focused.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":104,"selftext":"  There is a general consensus that compares the fall of SBF and FTX to Lehman brothers that triggered the 2008 financial crisis. But the FTX fallout can be compared to Bernie Maddoff Ponzi Scheme and especially to Elizabeth Holmes who defrauded the Theranos investors of hundreds of millions.\n\nElizabeth Holmes was the tech\u2019s sweetheart not long ago until her scheme was finally toppled. She founded Theranos Company that claimed it has developed technology that will revolutionize blood-testing industry. In 2015, her company was valued at 9 billion USD making her the youngest self-made billionaire. Her downfall was made possible by a series of journalistic investigations that challenged her claims in devising such technology.\n\nIn the scheme that is well-known by now, SBF lent billions of customer money to his other company, Alameda to invest in \u201crisky\u201d businesses. This is an illegal practice in other ventures, because lending customer funds should be carried out with their consent.\n\nSBF and Holmes were both the sweethearts of their respective industry and people just assumed that they would do no wrong. They both kept defrauding their investors\/customers. Both of them rode the hype train and people just ignored all red flags because people were so blinded by the hype.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":32,"selftext":"As someone who grew up in Houston and remembers going to Enron Field, and the complete and utter chaos caused by what was at the time the largest bankruptcy in history hearing the word Enron catches my attention. For those that have not heard of the Enron Scandal or were too young to remember it the company was publicly traded and had a market cap of around $67 billion in 2000 which was just crazy. It then turned out that the accounting team had cooked the books in ways that had never been seen before and like any house of cards it came crashing down resulting in a lot of people, especially those employed by the company, losing everything as their retirements were all in Enron stock. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I heard that  John J. Ray III was the person put in charge of handling FTX's massive bankruptcy I knew the name rang a bell but I could not place it. Know knowing that he was the one in charge of Enron after it declared bankruptcy it is safe to say the guy has seen some of the craziest collapses and had to try and pick up pieces for investors after the fact. I think for the most part people understood that FTX's books were going to be a complete and utter mess but I do not think the true nature could be understood without the experience and knowledge of Mr. Ray III. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile Enron had some pretty strict corporate controls seeing the statement, \u201cNever in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information.\u201d Even though FTX was run by a young kid it did have some people who used to work in the US government in the SEC and CFTC that held key posts so to see this is striking. It also seems like this company might have been more of a house of cards than initially thought as the audited financial statements are having to be redone from the ground up and the value of assets found so far is dramatically lower than expected. Only $740 million in crypto has been located and moved to cold storage while another $560 million in various other assets have been located as well. It is mind-boggling that the way that SBF and FTX operated involved not having a clue how much cash they had while wheeling and dealing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo end this on a positive note I do think that having John J. Ray III in charge of the bankruptcy is a really good move as he has handled these monumental cases before so hopefully he can continue to produce results for those affected.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yxwg79\/when_the_person_tasked_with_enrons_bankruptcy\/","author":"Status_Floor1746","num_comments":34,"created_utc":1668706993000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"When the Person Tasked with Enron's Bankruptcy Management is Saying Your Company is the Worst He's Dealt With that is Saying Something","distinguished":null,"id":"yxwg79","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":12,"selftext":"On May 12, 2022,  the House Agriculture Committee held a hearing entitled \u201cChanging Market Roles: The FTX Proposal and Trends in New Clearinghouse Models.\u201d At this hearing SBF outlined FTX\u2019s proposal to offer margined derivatives products in a non-intermediated model. At this hearing, Terrence Duffy, Chairman and CEO, CME Group, called bullshit on SBF.  To save you having to watch the 3 hour hearing (I'll post a link at the bottom), Mr. Duffy made a very prescient observation: \n\n\"Under false claims of innovation that are little more than cost-cutting measures, FTX is proposing a risk management-lite clearing regime that would inject significant systemic risk into our financial systems. Their model comes at the expense of proven risk control practices, market integrity, and ultimately financial stability. This proposal would significantly increase market risk by removing up to $170 billion of loss-absorbing capital from the cleared derivatives markets, eliminating standard credit due diligence practices, and destroying risk management incentives by eliminating stakeholder capital requirements and mutualized risks.\"\n\n\"The FTX proposal to auto-liquidate any customer that is under margin at any moment jeopardizes market stability. Auto-liquidation can exacerbate volatility and create dramatic price moves during times of turbulence. This could lead to a repeated pattern of price declines followed by additional liquidations. This will build losses on top of losses and drive prices down further.\"\n\n\" If the Commission approves this proposal for cryptocurrency products, it will not be able to keep FTX or others from expanding into other asset classes. To suggest otherwise would put all market participants at an extreme disadvantage.

Worked fine until people wanted the actual BTC. If not, then I think the following is another plausible explanation that the BTC was originally purchased on chain but has since been sold.\n\nThe FTX collapse brought awareness that exchanges may have already traded away depositors' bitcoin. FTX's balance sheet reported an 83,000 BTC liability (due to customers and other creditors) but had zero BTC assets. The exchange is 100% insolvent to its BTC creditors. The impact of these 83,000 BTC has likely already been realized on the market as sold or liquidated.\n\nThe exchanges that are forced to freeze withdrawals, have likely run out of BTC to return to customers, at least for the moment. Their chances of surviving the mass exodus, depends on rationing customer withdrawals while they attempt to regain possession of the BTC deployed in other investments, trades, and loans. Depending on the level of risk and risk mitigation these exchanges took, will determine how successful they'll be in their efforts. Be thankful if you're unaffected and have kept your crypto safe in a private wallet.\n\nWith that said, did the cascading effect of liquidations, trigger the sell of most of these BTC and the declining price cause lenders to sell customers' BTC to close loans?

I again assumed these leveraged loans required deposits that exceeded the loan amount?  I also thought they ftt was on a strict supply curve so again the community would notice if they were excess printing. \n\nTldr: is their a way users can be assured of an exchanges asset base to guarantee financial health against its obligations? \n\nHow did Ftx print excess ftt tokens if the supply curve was defined?\n\nDoes blockchain tech allow users to see an exchanges liquidity versus its obligations?  Does blockchain tech show how leveraged an exchange is?  \n\nAlso curious to hear what kind of exchange leverage best practices should come out of this?  Do not leverage at all? Leverage only a small amount for short terms only? How do you not get rekt when leveraging as an exchange?!?!\n\nThanks.\n\n## Comment about beginner friendliness\n\nHonestly, I'm one of the least beginner friendly persons you may find. Decades ago I moderated a forum and RTFM was my favorite acronym.\n\nHowever, the appalling confusion of many beginners, critics, regulators, and society in general are only helping scammers, grifters, and bad actors in general. \n\nFor example, FTX is (or was) a crypto company. Nevertheless, it is closer to Goldman Sachs than to Bitcoin. [Related](https:\/\/twitter.com\/trylks\/status\/1593304316852543491), but for the mainstream it is crypto, and that's it. There's a significant confusion about the transparency of a CEXes (see questions above, short answer: no, FTX is not blockchain, it's a database for internal operations), and it is for several reasons:\n\n1. SBF probably lied about it, and if people didn't know better, they would believe him.\n1. There's no reference manual for beginners to learn (\u201ccrypto for dummies\u201d if you want).\n1. The previous manual is in fact very hard to write: too simplistic will be misleading, too complex will be unsuitable for the average person.\n1. The previous point results in the dilemma of how get more adoption: more simple crypto, or better education to better handle its complexity. As usual, why not both?\n1. More simple is not about making it centralized, but about [account abstraction](https:\/\/twitter.com\/adietrichs\/status\/1591128142844162048), probably. Most important: not centralized.\n1. Better education could be as simple as a pinned FAQ here.*\n1. In either case, I think we all can do more (myself included, this is just one bit) because the current confusion feeds bad actors, and that's not good for anybody.\n\nYou may not agree with my points here, but I hope they provide interesting food for thought.\n\n\n\\* Honestly, I could not find a guide I would like, so I wrote it myself just for friends and family. I know nowadays YouTube videos are the popular approach, but they are too long IMHO. Information overload helps nobody (the irony of writing this in a 4M words post\u2026) information overload is a big problem nowadays, and it is a big problem for crypto, because beginners find themselves lost in an ocean of information and misinformation and scammers and grifters are quick to offer a \u201chelping\u201d hand.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yy88nl\/beginner_questions_and_a_comment_about_beginners\/","author":"Trylks","num_comments":2,"created_utc":1668737141000,"edited":1668737403000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"Beginner questions and a comment about beginners","distinguished":null,"id":"yy88nl","downs":null,"ups":null}

It's the same principle as your debit card doesn't hold your money, but can interact with a card network to move money from your bank.\n\nThis means that as long as you have your seed phrase, all you would need to do in the event of the collapse of a given wallet app would be to put your seed phrase into another wallet app and you're up and running again with all your tokens.\n\nThe absolute worst case I can see would be a malicious update being pushed out in the wallet app that tries to steal your seed phrase or something like that.

It would be ideal for you to opt for hardware wallet such as ledger or trezor! That way you can access your crypto without risking hacks or priv key\/seed theft.\n\nYou can find plenty of videos that will explain ins and outs of ledger and trezor.\n\nMy experience and Research:\n\nMy funds were in binance but after FTX collapse. Not your keys, not your coins kicked in hard.\n\nSoftware self custudy wallets like exodus and TrustWallet for example. I looked into these but i remembered i got into crypto 5 years back. There were many companies and exchanges from that time\u2026 that are no more. I was confused what if trust wallet or any other wallet powered by x y z company went offline for good. What happens then?\n\nP.S TrustWallet is owned by Binance! But it is open source as well. Confusion\u2026 confusion.\n\nBy this time i felt hardware wallets were the only option. But by the time i would get one delivered and setup\u2026 it might be too late.\n\nYears back when i first got into crypto i created a paper wallet. Stored it offline for a couple of years. Only used it once to move funds to binance this year.\n\nI decided to check what happens if ledger is broken or dies.

Plugged it into an old laptop(harddisk removed). Booted ubuntu from live usb and used iancoleman tool to create 24 word seedphrase. Which generated wallet public address and private keys. I wrote it down on paper and made a copy on encrypted drive. \n\nFor info on how to use this tool you can watch: https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=j5nejoEGWFw\n\nTransfered $10 worth of crypto from binance to new wallet. It worked.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":4,"selftext":"1. SBF had a big ego. He would do loads of interviews and tweets, always having to say about himself or what his company was doing.  It was him first, FTX(and Alameda) second. *Many crypto founders\/CEO's have this problem.*\n2. SBF was greedy. Yes it is a common human trait, but SBF was dead set on acquiring every crypto firm and would have done so if he could. He managed to acquire dozens and have equity\/stake in hundreds.\n3. Tying in with no.2, why would a trustworthy crypto founder involve themselves with projects like Aptos and heavily in Solana, who are 'messy' projects, to put it nicely.\n4. We know how politics and lobbying works, but SBF being the second largest donor to a political party, second-only to *George Soros*, ought to raise some serious flags, *regardless* of your political associations.\n5. FTX conducted two funding rounds this year alone. These amounted to $400M and $420M. Funding rounds in and of themselves aren't bad, but can indicate financial weakness. Certainly doing two in a year is odd.\n6. FTX had 27 'promotions and competitions' to encourage trading last year. This went up to 47 this year of 2022. In 2022, they did 9 of the promotion of: trade -insert token- to win from a pool of -token-. This type is a quick and dirty way for exchanges to encourage trading that costs them nothing. You way win something like 10USD. Eight of these \"Win From A Pool\" promotions were done in **October alone.** They did **none** of this type of promo in 2021.\n7. During the chaos after the Binance FTT liquidation announcement when users started withdrawing in mass, they felt the need to 'thank customers for all their support' with long-winded words and talk about how well their systems were doing. A very common deflection tactic.\n8. When the withdrawals were at their peak, FTX Twitter page was tweeting about their expensive new HQ building and memes about about a dog and a flying lawnmower that was captioned 'There Is No Need To Be Upset'. The now-deleted posts can be [viewed here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yt6mpr\/watch_sbf_and_his_firm_distract_on_their_twitter\/). Another deflection tactic, instead of addressing the situation and acting professionally to placate users with facts since they could lose everything.\n9. This one is admittedly only for experienced cryptonians. The FTX total supply was always much larger(almost 3X) than the circulating supply. It always struck me as odd as to where the rest of the issued supply was if it wasn't circulating(on the market).\n\nAdmittedly, none of the signs by themselves are exactly clear cut. But taken together they plaint a glaring picture. Some even only presented themselves only days before the eventual collapse, but at least we could have saved our funds at the last moment,  Hopefully ,this event yields lessons we can all learn from.\n\n[https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/crypto-exchange-ftx-raises-fresh-capital-now-valued-at-32-billion-135617687.html](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/crypto-exchange-ftx-raises-fresh-capital-now-valued-at-32-billion-135617687.html)\n\n[https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/10\/21\/crypto-exchange-ftx-raises-420-million-at-25-billion.html](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/10\/21\/crypto-exchange-ftx-raises-420-million-at-25-billion.html)","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yylftt\/signs_we_could_have_predicted_ftx_would_collapse\/","author":"OneThatNoseOne","num_comments":18,"created_utc":1668781764000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ADVICE","title":"Signs We Could Have Predicted FTX Would Collapse.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":320,"selftext":"I'm still a small fish in the crypto scene, started with spare-time mining with my home PC in spring of 2021. As my assets slowly grew I was happy to keep my bags on exchanges where they were responsible for the keys instead of me. I saw horror stories of people losing their seed phrases or getting scammed and figured that wasn't worth the risk while I didn't really know what I was doing. I started on Coinbase, and eventually added assets on Kraken and Gemini. Transaction fees would chew up a significant amount of my meager earnings and my net worth certainly didn't justify the investment of a hardware wallet.\n\nI lost a chunk of my portfolio with the LUNA crash, but steadied on, watching and waiting. Then the FTX crash. Luckily they were not one of my chosen exchanges but it became clear that the risk of me screwing up my keys was no longer greater than the risk of a large exchange freezing all assets and locking me out. I started looking at non-custodial wallets and planning to move my larger bags off of the exchanges.\n\nWith the news that Genesis was halting withdrawals and Gemini might not be able to fill earn redemptions in the promised time I knew it was time to secure my assets. Here's what I ended up using:\n\n**Coinbase Wallet** (BTC &amp; ETH): ironically, I went with an exchange-branded software wallet for the majority of my assets. I withdrew BTC from Gemini with no problem (started with a small test transfer first). Took less than 5 minutes. Connected to my Coinbase exchange account and was easy to transfer my BTC &amp; ETH from my exchange balance to the wallet. All transfer fees were ~$0.50 or so.\n\n**Yoroi Wallet** (ADA): The remainder of my significant holdings were in ETH and ADA on Kraken. But the ETH withdrawal fee from Kraken was going to be over $4, which was a significant percentage of my holdings there (I told you I'm a small fish, right?). I already had a decent sized ADA bag so I exchanged my ETH to ADA and sent it to my new Yoroi wallet. From there it was easy to delegate to a staking pool and start earning staking rewards without having to lose custody of my crypto.\n\nI have a few smaller bags that I wanted to hold on to (MATIC, BAT, and others) that I decided to keep on the exchanges for now because the transfer fees are much too big of a percentage of the total worth to transfer in (and back out) of a private wallet. If the exchanges go down, so be it.\n\n**New things I learned**: Your BTC wallet can have multiple public addresses. It freaked me out at first when my address changed after the first transfer. If you want to track your wallet balance on a portfolio tracker like accointing you need to find or generate your wallet's xPub address (Yoroi provides it in the \"export\" menu, I had to find a tool to generate it from my seed phrase for the Coinbase Wallet). Aside from Kraken's ETH withdrawal fee the transfer fees were actually a lot lower than I feared they would be, which makes it even more worthwhile for the small fish to take this step.\n\nAnd we did it, Reddit. I now have over 90% of my assets in a self-custodial wallet, ready to ride out whatever storms may come. I do still trust Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken 100% and will use them in the future but the entire landscape is very treacherous right now. Time to grab a nice hot beverage, snuggle under a blanket and ride out this winter.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yymkoo\/i_did_it_i_finally_pulled_my_crypto_off_the\/","author":"ejkook","num_comments":172,"created_utc":1668784763000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANECDOTAL","title":"I did it, I finally pulled my crypto off the exchanges","distinguished":null,"id":"yymkoo","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":2,"selftext":"The last weeks FTX collapse shook the world of crypto which cost billions of trader's fortunes. The catalyst for this crisis was the trading firm founded by Sam Bankman-Fried himself, SBF loaned billions in the firm while having FTX's native token held as collateral.\n\nThe Bankruptcy Saga started from a scoop questioning the platform's liquidity, the heart of the issue is FTX's native token FTT. In a rapid series of events, the massive sell-off caused the downfall of the platform, the platform even attempted to work behind their biggest rivals back by moving their FTT tokens to Binance. CZ then issued a statement about FTX that succumb the world of crypto. But just as quickly as CZ offered its rescue package in the form of an acquisition, the company backed out.\n\nThere was more to unfold from the incident as news reports broke out about mishandle customer funds, self-interest and many more that are yet to be unveiled but Sam Bankman-Fried opted to his last resort and that is to file bankruptcy. The situation got even worse as within a few hours after SBF filed for bankruptcy, FTX was hacked and close to $500 million in assets was hacked.\n\nSo now, how will these affect the trust on centralized exchanges? and what are its aftermath? \nCZ says that \"proof of reserves\" can restore trust in crypto industry, the indisputable kingpin tweeted that Proof of reserves will provide transparency hence will retain users in their platform. Long before the firestorm, Binance was already the largest crypto exchange. Following this move, platforms like Kraken, Coinbase and Gate.io have also published their proof of reserves to retain their users trusts. Earlier this morning I have received an email from Binance showing their commitment to its users, OKX is reportedly sending an email to their users also. While exchanges are showing proof of reserves, MEXC Global upgraded its brand color from Forest Green to Ocean Blue to celebrate their 10million user milestone. Along with Bybit, MEXC Global &amp; OKX is reportedly publishing their proof of reserves soon. Another notable exchange who published their proof-of-reserves are Crypto.com and Huobi, both are expected to be composing their liabilites report and will post it soon as well.\n\nWith the catastrophe the whole crypto space was facing the past few weeks, Its still astounding how centralized exchanges are committed to restore user confidence, providing transparency, safety for our funds and having the \"User comes first\" principle.\n\nUsers like me certainly hope that these incidents will not hamper crypto adaption in the coming years, as one thing is for sure regulations will be imposed following this incident.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yypq4l\/the_ftx_effect_the_aftermath_and_restoring_trust\/","author":"Ill-Medicine-7496","num_comments":18,"created_utc":1668792808000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"EXCHANGES","title":"The FTX effect, The Aftermath and restoring trust on Centralized Exchanges.","distinguished":null,"id":"yypq4l","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":18,"selftext":"I have been around the crypto space for a few years now but only after the collapse of FTX did I finally go out and buy a hardware wallet. I have kept my coins on exchanges such FTX, Coinbase, BlockFi up until this past week and never really thought twice about it. I\u2019ve seen the term \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d dozens of times a day, but I was naive to think that something could happen to the big exchanges I used that would compromise my coins. \n\nI know I am not the only one who felt that way. A sense of security in a business that seemed it was too big to fail. Unfortunately, none of us really know what\u2019s goes on behind the scenes of these CEXs as these past few weeks have shown. I was lucky as I had a good chunk of assets in FTX at the beginning of 2022. I luckily withdrew them out to BlockFi to earn interest on top of the rewards I received with their credit card. Again, I lucky withdrew those funds to Coinbase not too long ago when the APY on my coins with BlockFi weren\u2019t worth it anymore. \n\nI dodged two bullets with the FTX and BlockFi news, only losing a few hundred in total with residuals left behind. With the uncertainty and mass withdrawals from the CEXs this week I finally decided to take charge of my own coins. I should have done this much sooner. Within 30 min of setting up my Ledger I successfully took my coins off the exchanges and into cold storage. It was extremely easy and straightforward. Now I can sleep at night without the worry of waking up to my CEX going bankrupt and my coins gone. The cost of the hardware wallet is worth the peace of mind. Do yourself a favor and take control of your assets. Don\u2019t risk your hard earned investments to these entities that couldn\u2019t care less about you.

FTX was launched in May 2019. The company made $85 million in 2020 and $1.02 billion in 2021 (over a 1000% increase from the previous year).  Over the past two years, FTX grew at an insane rate, making it one of the quickest companies to reach a valuation of $10+ billion.\n2. Democrats control the presidency, house, and senate from 2020-2022.\n3. A democrat controlled federal government (with the exception of the Supreme Court which is irrelevant in this case) gave tons of money in aid to Ukraine in their efforts against Russia. The largest aid package included $40 billion. Do keep in mind that a majority of money sent to other countries go to humanitarian aid and crisis groups such as Aid for Ukraine and not the Ukrainian government\n4. FTX partnered with Ukrainian government officials and Aid for Ukraine to convert cryptocurrency donations into fiat currency.\n5. Former founder and CEO of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, donated nearly $40 million to the Democratic Party in this midterm election cycle and became the party's second largest mega-donor.\n6. The 2022 US midterm elections were held on November 8th, 2022.\n7. FTX collapses, implodes, whatever you wanna call it, on November 11th, 2022.\n8. FTX is hacked for hundreds of millions of dollars.\n9. The SEC led by democrat Gary Gensler regularly met with SBF and FTX over financials and such. It is also worth noting that \"only a month before FTX imploded, he was instead engaged in a highly theatrical enforcement action against Kim Kardashian over a minor token sale from 2021.\" \n\n10. EDIT: This is added in after original post but SBF donated around $262,000 to the Republican Party.\n\nWell that's all I've got for now. There may be more in the future or that I am unaware of.

I did a small test transaction and it took less than 3 minutes for it to go from submission to in transit, and then to be received into my Ledger.  I proceeded to move the rest of the daily limit in RH (about 3.9 eth), and the transaction is still in the submission stage for going on an hour now.  Out of curiosity after about 20 minutes I sent another small transaction to my ledger and it took less than 2 minutes.\n\nNot being a block chain expert, I am looking to understand if there is a block chain related reason why 3.9 eth would take longer than a tiny amount-   or if this may be a sign that Robinhood is being Robinhood and purposefully delaying transactions that are larger.  If anyone has had this issue with RH or other exchanges - I'm hoping to gain some insight or maybe spark some conversation as to what it could mean.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":0,"selftext":"Being an F1 fan, I keep watching the F1 news. And since nine of ten teams in F1 have crypto sponsors, I get to hear about crypto as well. For those that don\u2019t know, FTX was one of the sponsors for the Mercedes F1 Team. In fact, FTX was the sponsor for a host of other teams, companies, and whatnot. But sponsoring Mercedes and some of the NBA teams gave them a lot of credibility. I think that\u2019s where the misuse was.\n\nAnyway, while the FTX debacle was unfolding and all teams, companies, and even smaller exchanges were distancing themselves from the disgraced exchange, Mercedes took their time. Ironically, the German team was the only one that continued to host the logo on their cars for the longest. It was only on the eve of the Brazilian Grand Prix that the team finally removed the logo.\n\nThis is how the FTX logo appeared on the car (left image), and this is now since the last race. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/m5jdqt26av0a1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c9c7a843fd85c4119c1e9e79e9d6df3eaaebd2f\n\nAlso, I am not certain that Mercedes has to depend on FTX\u2019s sponsorship as much as, say, some other teams with less financial muscle. I mean, Petronas is the title sponsor for Mercedes, while Mercedes, as a company, too is quite strong in funding the races. However, it is the smaller teams that have to worry. \n\nDid you know that ***Floki Inu funded the Alfa Romeo*** team; I repeat, Floki Inu. \ud83d\ude0a Imagine if that sponsor falls off the grid for Alfa Romeo. That would make a lot of difference. Either way, if Floki can fund an F1 team, why can\u2019t they market themselves better or improve their offerings than just being a meme token? Makes me wonder.\n\nAnyway, the news is that Mercedes cut off all ties with FTX only a couple of days back (see how long they took), and maybe it has to do with the German way. They are quite meticulous in partnering as well as parting ways. Hope it worked for them and hope they really got money from FTX.\n\nLast, as all would have said, get your coins\/tokens to your own wallet.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":2,"selftext":"Hi all \\[tm\\]\n\nI've been looking through FTX's balance sheet over the past few days.  Originally I focused on their \"Semi-liquid\" assets (their categorization).  I won't go into much detail.  See [my post here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/ywpikb\/ftx_accounting_fraud_in_depth_look\/) for more information on that.  Highlight is them valuing their $SRM ($100M market cap shitcoin) at $2.1 Billion USD.\n\nToday I want to look at the \"illiquid\" category, specifically the entry for \"Anthropic\" listed at $500M USD.  $500M represents more than 5% of the outstanding customer liabilities (from the information made public).  It is one of the largest assets remaining on their balance sheet, especially once you eliminate the fraudulent entries from their \"Semi-liquid\" assets section consisting of their own shitcoins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo **what is Anthropic?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Website: [https:\/\/www.anthropic.com\/](https:\/\/www.anthropic.com\/)\n* *Anthropic is an AI safety and research company that\u2019s working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. Large, general systems of today can have significant benefits, but can also be unpredictable, unreliable, and opaque: our goal is to make progress on these issues. For now, we\u2019re primarily focused on research towards these goals; down the road, we foresee many opportunities for our work to create value commercially and for public benefit.*\n* Raised $124M in a Series A: [https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/funding\\_round\/anthropic-series-a--61db4cbd](https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/funding_round\/anthropic-series-a--61db4cbd)\n* Raised $580M in a Series B: [https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/funding\\_round\/anthropic-series-b--cbef655b](https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/funding_round\/anthropic-series-b--cbef655b)\n* [https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/anthropicresearch\/](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/anthropicresearch\/)\n* Anthropic was founded by siblings Dario Amodei and Daniela Amodei in 2021.\n\nOkay, we have some decent information here.  For starts, Anthropic is basically a \"company\" that is focused on AI research.  They have no specific product, no intention to make any specific product, and no clear path to revenue of any kind.  The lead investor on the Series A is [Jaan Tallinn](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jaan_Tallinn), a computer scientist who co-founded Skype.\n\nJaan is also the co-founder of the non-profit \"Future of Life Institute\" which [works to reduce global catastrophic and existential risks facing humanity, particularly existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Future_of_Life_Institute).  Elon Musk serves on the board as an advisor.\n\n[Anthropic then ran a Series B](https:\/\/www.anthropic.com\/news\/announcement#series-b) in late April 2022, led by Sam Bankman-Fried, who \"invested\" $500M.  Other investors included **Caroline Ellison** and **Nishad Singh.**  Sam's investment alone represents over 71% of all capital raised by the company.  We do not have visibility into the size of Caroline Ellison and Nishad Singh's investment.\n\nQuestions quickly arise here.  What are the FTX squad doing investing $500M+ in an AI research project?  This money was entirely derived from fraud and theft of customer funds on the FTX platform.  Anthropic has not yet released a statement on the matter.\n\nStill, it seems incomprehensible that they would keep these funds now that their source is confirmed to be fraud\/theft.  Even worse is that customer funds appear to be invested into research projects which have little-to-no focus on commercial applications.  In some ways, Anthropic appears to be an extension of Jaan Tallinn's Future of Life Institute, minus the non-profit status.\n\nEither way, FTX customers should be furious that their money has been donated to obscure research projects and listed as a company asset.  The team at Anthropic have not made any indication that they are looking to return the stolen funds they have received.\n\nAll together, this is a very suspicious investment.  I'd love to see more research done on the web of connections here and how they relate back to FTX.  Come on Reddit, let's get these crooks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nSome more details from research.\n\nJaan Tallinn (Wikipedia)\n\n *Tallinn participates in the* [*effective altruism*](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Effective_altruism) *movement and donated $604,500 to the effective altruism associated* [*Machine Intelligence Research Institute*](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Machine_Intelligence_Research_Institute) *since 2015.*[*\\[20\\]*](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jaan_Tallinn#cite_note-20)[*\\[21\\]*](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jaan_Tallinn#cite_note-21)[*\\[22\\]*](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jaan_Tallinn#cite_note-22) *In addition, his initial donation, in 2012, when co-founding the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk was around $200,000.*[*\\[7\\]*](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jaan_Tallinn#cite_note-2019-03-28-gu-7) \n\nEffective Altruism = link to Sam\n\nFounded \"Centre for the Study of Existential Risk\" which also invested in Series A &amp; B round for Anthropic","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yz7xpx\/investigating_ftxs_investment_in_anthropicai_500m\/","author":"chuck_portis","num_comments":7,"created_utc":1668849811000,"edited":1668852410000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"Investigating FTX's Investment in \"AnthropicAI\" ($500M)","distinguished":null,"id":"yz7xpx","downs":null,"ups":null}

This applies to cross-chain assets like: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Dogecoin, and ADA. If you are trying to get your money out of Binance and withdraw it as a BEP2\/20 token it's the equivalent of right-click saving an NFT.\n\nWhen you right-click save an NFT you own a digital file not located on the native blockchain. When you convert native crypto assets to a BEP2\/20 token you own digital tokens not located on the native blockchain. In either case, you don't own the original item.\n\nWhen you withdraw to the BSC, you give your native asset to Binance and they give you a token representation of your asset on the BSC. The Binance Smart Chain is a defi ecosystem, you should only withdraw your crypto to the BSC, for the sole purpose of interacting with the defi ecosystem. You should never withdraw crypto to BSC to hold long-term, **especially if you're trying to get your money away from CEX's**.\n\n\\-------------------------\n\nWhen FTX failed the value of wrapped BTC on Solana plummeted because people weren't sure if it was still backed by FTX.

[Now I should say](https:\/\/www.binance.com\/en\/blog\/ecosystem\/binance-and-bnb-chain-whats-the-difference-6186229776062522437), \"the Binance Chain\/Smart Chain are independent blockchains, not operated or controlled solely by Binance, but community driven\" - so a failure of Binance would not guarantee the failure of BC or BSC. So all those other projects on the Binance chain like Squid Games, Safe Moon or Baby Squid - may or may not be safe when other bridged assets, lose all pegs.\n\nBut here's the thing... If you wrap a native token to BEP2\/20 you don't own the original - you own a copy located elsewhere.

This means that all they preparations and paperwork must have been in order before the actual date of filing. However, since the 11th to date, Alameda wallets have transacted over $50M. This was mainly in FTT, USDT and smaller amounts in BitDAO as well as even smaller values across various tokens.

Again, I'm not sure how bankruptcy and assets disclosure, seizure and management is exactly supposed to work but I don't think it's supposed to look like this.\n\nMany transactions occurred in USDC and FTT and smaller amounts in various tokens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[USDC to 0x235...](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/uk1puzg55x0a1.png?width=1370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99a060aab01e138cd7b7ac8d13930d6bece484dc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[0x235... to Binance](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d6kmu1549x0a1.png?width=1382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c462880bb5f8b808250a4f8ec0788c44ad86824e)\n\n[FTT transactions](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ntgdx3yeyw0a1.png?width=1341&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73f703960ca1e4bed254bbb1bdec3dfcba0eab6a)\n\nWith all the news, rumours and unsubstantiated facts going around these days I want to be clear and fair. Best case, funds are owed to Alameda and coming from a counterparty where from where they are being stored on Binance. But given SBF\/CZ relations, this is hard to believe. Plus, it looks like Alameda is actively shifting funds **out of** other exchanges as well as self-custody and **into** Binance, evidenced by these of transactions of 500k of FTT and 282M SPELL that show funds being drained from other exchanges of Bitfinex and Arbitrum and into Binance.  And why not just keep the funds in self-custody?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[500k FTT to Binance\\[repeated for easier reading\\]](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/m5x2x8qoqw0a1.png?width=1371&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d7f42b306451345ba9a3b99c318638ea2f3db34)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[282M SPELL from L1 to Alameda](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/lrncvp250x0a1.png?width=1382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80dca2404177a0178c18879ab87f4cff5876cf82)\n\n[282M SPELL from Alameda to Binance](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/m2udhlxxzw0a1.png?width=1382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8edcef2f149ecc42a6c4b24e5029e1e761adf61)\n\nThis 500k FTT transaction to Binance on 11th Nov also appear to be wholly separate from the over 100M FTT tokens that were basically drained and stolen from the FTX deployer that took place 2 to 3 days later on the 13th Nov, which Binance and Huobi blocked deposits of. Of course, it goes without saying the fact that Alameda was still playing with their ponzi\/pyramid\/scam FTT tokens at the time of bankruptcy is pathetic up to as late as yesterday.\n\nIn the worst case scenario however, well given what we now know about SBF, these transactions are only revelations about how badly rotten the whole situation is, as if it were even possible to worsen more than we already knew. I could speculate, but my imagination wouldn't even be able to do justice.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yzf11m\/alameda_research_transacted_over_50m_since_date\/","author":"OneThatNoseOne","num_comments":19,"created_utc":1668873333000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANALYSIS","title":"Alameda Research Transacted Over $50M Since Date of Bankruptcy, With $11M Deposited To Binance.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":15,"selftext":" With all the recent hacks going around in crypto. Here is a list of some of the biggest hacks this year: \n\nRonin Network\n\nThe $625 million hack on Ronin Network ranks as one of the most notable crypto hacks of 2022. \n\nMany of the cryptographic keys used to protect the Axie Infinity cross-chain bridge's security have been compromised by hackers. It appears that an Axie developer clicked on a fake job posting that was a PDF. \n\nFour out of the nine private keys required for transaction authentication were taken by the attacker, who also transferred about 25.5 million USDC and 173,600 ETH to their wallets. \n\nWhen a customer attempted to withdraw money in a proper manner, the network realized there had been a hack. Axie Infinity's founders, Sky Mavis, claim that in order to prevent any further financial losses, they have enlisted the help of forensic cryptographers, law enforcement agents, and investors. \n\n## Crypto.com\n\nThe well-known centralized exchange Crypto.com is yet another notable example from the list of cryptocurrency hacks. \n\nOn January 17, 2022, it lost $35 million due to a cryptocurrency hack. What was the reason behind the hack of Crypto.com? \n\nThe two-factor authentication. Hackers removed the essential identity verification feature and stole customers' Bitcoin and Ether from their accounts. However, the CEO of Crypto.com initially denied that money had been lost in the cryptocurrency hack. A few days later, the exchange was forced to admit the hack. \n\n## Binance\n\nThe October 2022 hack of the Binance exchange, which resulted in a loss of $570 million, became one of the most well-known attacks. The BSC Token Hub, a cross-chain bridge, served as the hack's main entry point. Hackers used the bridge to their advantage and produced more BNB tokens before taking 2 million of them out. The hack highlighted the need for further blockchain security improvement, with a focus on fixing security flaws in smart contract code. Trust Financial IRA\n\n## IRA Financial Trust\n\nOn February 8, 2022, a cryptocurrency hack caused a loss of almost $37 million for The IRA Financial Trust. It is a cryptocurrency-based retirement and pension payment system with the potential to promote cryptocurrency adoption by the general public. \n\nHowever, by gaining access to a master key, hackers were able to compromise platform assets and get around all security precautions. IRA Financial Trust responded by criticizing Gemini for the hack. It appears that the IRA Financial Trust used the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange's services to store customer funds. Security enhancements are needed because the cryptocurrency exchange has been charged with negligence that caused the hack. \n\n## Wormhole\n\nWormhole lost $325 million as a result of a cryptocurrency hack on February 2, 2022, while serving as a Solana to Ethereum bridge. \n\nHackers had taken advantage of the platform's smart contracts to mint and withdraw wrapped Ether without putting up any collateral. The protocol's GitHub repository underwent an upgrade that had not been applied to the live project, making the smart contract vulnerability possible. \n\nWith a loss of SOL tokens valued at $47 million, the Wormhole hack appears to have been the largest theft of Solana. Because the funds were not recovered, the network then had to replenish the project's assets. The affected Solana-based platforms were kept solvent by Jump Crypto, the venture capital firm that supports the Wormhole protocol. Wormhole also renamed its bridge to \"Portal,\",\n\nIt's a surprise we are still standing after so many hacks and whatnot","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/yzzz7e\/the_biggest_crypto_hacks_this_year_before_ftx\/","author":"gh0stking7","num_comments":35,"created_utc":1668936849000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANALYSIS","title":"The Biggest crypto hacks this year before FTX","distinguished":null,"id":"yzzz7e","downs":null,"ups":null}

This time he talks crypto and his takes on FTX and the crypto space lead to a very interesting conclusion and one I frankly didn't really expect from him:\n\n\n\"Finally, if exchanges are not necessarily the future, what will remain of cryptocurrency? To those, like my friend Nouriel Roubini, who have long predicted the collapse of the \u201csh**coins,\u201d 2022 has been a good year. Readers of his new book, Megathreats, will relish his demolition of crypto as a giant Ponzi scheme dreamt up by \u201cscammers and carnival-barkers\u201d to fleece na\u00efve retail investors suffering from internet-induced FOMO. A great many crypto coins and tokens will indeed go to zero \u2014 indeed, many already have. Yet I am still not convinced that the experiment with blockchain-based finance will end up being a total failure.\n\nIf Roubini had been around in the 1720s, he likely would have said the last rites for stocks with equal fervor. But the bursting of the Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles did not mark the end of equity financing and stock trading, any more than the many financial panics of the 19th century marked the end of joint-stock banking.\n\nOn the contrary, both stock markets and banks went on to play a crucial role in financing the later phases of the Industrial Revolution. As Antonio Garcia Martinez put it, \u201cInnovation starts in mad genius and grift and bubbles, and ends in establishment institutions. ... Every Web titan you see about you \u2014 Square, Stripe, Twitter, Facebook, Airbnb, Uber \u2014 all launched or massively scaled after another such \u2026 panic. \u2026 And then what followed was the biggest tech boom of a generation.\u201d\n\nWill the current crypto winter be succeeded by a DeFi boom? Or will it be like the weather in C.S. Lewis\u2019s Narnia: always winter, never Christmas?

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":417,"selftext":"####**Intro and TL;DR**\n\nYou've probably seen the news about the FTX hacker account.\n\n**There is so much going in this account that anything you think is happening is probably done to hide his tracks.** Dozens of tokens and DeFi swap have been used. Some tokens have been sent over Polygon PoS and Bitcoin bridges. PAXG seemed to be his favorite token by far for token laundering before that was blocked. Since then, he has created at least 11 addresses trying to escape everywhere.\n\nThese are all the tokens he's been swapping to:\n\n**stETH, USDT, LINK, USDP, LDO, WBTC, SUSHI, YFI, 1INCH, UNI, LINK, MATIC, PAXG, SHIB, AAVE, APE, PAXG, SNX, renBTC, WMATIC**\n\nI wouldn't trust anything posted by the media or random Twitter posts unless they're citing experts. This should be done by a professional trace analyzer because they have specialized tools for tracing this.\n\n**I do not believe the hacker is related to the Bahamian government. These transactions are much too random, chaotic, and swap for too many random token.** If it is the Bahamian government, then they're totally letting SBF create chaos with it.\n\nAFAICT, the hacker is not trying to sell ETH for BTC. I'm guessing he's trying to exit using whatever exchange or swap that hasn't yet blacklisted him. PAXG was the weak link on Nov 12. It's now $60M worth of ETH to WBTC and renBTC, which he's using to exit to BTC mainnet.\n\n**Update**: [ZachXBT mentioned](https:\/\/nitter.net\/zachxbt\/status\/1591475246250733568) that there are **multiple groups** with their hands in the cookie jar. There are several whitehat addresses, but this \"0x59...32b\" address is almost certainly a blackhat. That's why there is so much confusion about whether it's the Bahamian government or the group that Kraken knows. There are multiple groups working on different addresses.\n\n----------------\n\n####**Here's my best attempt at an amateur trace analysis**\n\n**There are at least 11 FTX hacker addresses**, most of which were created on the Nov 12. One last one was created today.\n\n**Main address**: https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x59abf3837fa962d6853b4cc0a19513aa031fd32b\n\n- **History**\n  - This one's been around for 8 days since Nov 12\n  - It's been growing ETH. Started with 160k ETH. Grew to 200k ETH  on Nov 15 and then to 250k ETH on Nov 19. 50k ETH has been swapped or transferred out today.\n  - On the first day, it was sent out to 26 different addresses.\n  - Apparently, he found out that PAXG swaps were the weakest link and was able to swap to $60M of it.\n  - Since then, it has stayed quiet (other than for shitcoin transfers) until today. There was 1 lone Tx on Nov 15 for token approval for [DAI on CoW Protocol](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/tx\/0x7b863b03815cc6ea7b1406d6d8dbea37b15c8eb8471d7c1c46f2126e38ab0f52)\n  - Suddenly today, it has become active again\n- **Current balance**\n  - 200k ETH, down from 250k ETH yesterday. that's a difference of about $60M USD worth of ETH that went elsewhere.\n  - $14M of PAXG\n  - 70+ random shit tokens. Some were sent by others to insult the owner. Some were swapped into by the owner.\n- **Nov 12 activity**\n  - This guy is an absolute DeFi degenerate. He's possibly testing for blacklists on his first day or trying to exit as fast as he can. He used over a dozen different swaps.\n  - Did tons of token approval.

Im sure we\u2019ve all seen several articles about the adept on-chain sleuthing done by these guys in the past. The question is how did they miss such a massive case of fraud and scheming?\n\nChainalysis were actually laid a handsome sum by *partnering* with FTX in 2019 to revamp their \u201canti-money laundering and KYC systems\u201d (hows that for comedy). They had access to their ledger data and on-chain transactions, hell Alameda was even listed as the beneficiary address for wire transfers when transacting with FTX OTC and Alameda was LITERALLY transferring funds from their trading wallet to FTX reserves. So much research has been done by crypto twitter and amateur blockchain sleuths, and a multibillion dollar firm that monitors trillions of asset transfers couldnt?\n\nHeres another kicker, Chainalysis also got a good amount of investment from **DCG** who we know also had significant exposure to FTX. As equity holders in Chainalysis (who is now confirmed to be a creditor in FTX bankruptcy), is it possible that maybe there was incentive to conceal knowledge of potential malfeasance by FTX?\n\nFrom my understanding, Chainalysis provides a paid service to businesses\/exchanges to use *at their discretion* to detect illicit activity. Its also possible that FTX only used it to detect incoming transfers and then beyond that didnt use the product internally, but at one point Chainalysis definitely had privileged access to their systems.

Historically Litecoin has seen a significant jump in price in the lead up to the halvening event.

However it is also very unclear whether this seizure refers to the entire sum of missing funds of FTX assets or just some portion of it. The tweet may *also* be referring to the 'stolen' sum of money that represents the balance of what regulators did not seize.

I've thought about it a lot and while some regulations would be great for crypto, it needs to be kept in mind that it won't stop there.\n\nWhat ever side of the spectrum your political beliefs are, what ever country you come from, you need to keep in mind that the government is not your friend. They are not out to protect minor investors, they are out to protect the people who have the power to sway them. \n\nStealing from your customers is already illegal. What Bankman has done is absolutely criminal. Whether he gets away with it is up in the air, but if he does it's not because crypto isn't regulated. It's because white collar criminals don't get punished for breaking the law. \n\nWhether the government views crypto as actual currency or funny monopoly money makes no difference here. What regulation actually looks like is the exact thing we should be fighting against.\n\nThe people claiming they are just looking after the small investors are currently paying the new CEO over a thousand bucks AN HOUR, while also claiming people who were able to withdrawal before FTX collapsed may have their money taken back to \"protect\" the investors.\n\nIt's the Tornado cash developer sitting in jail for writing code. It's XRP getting dragged through court by the SEC. Stable coins freezing wallets at the request of governments. Corporations writing laws that force you onto their centralized platforms. \n\nHow long until governments decide that monero and your favorite dex are nothing but \"tools used by criminals for money laundering and regulation evasion?\". How many of your favorite projects would never have gotten off the ground because the government claims it's just an IPO?\n\nCrypto is wonderful exactly because it is a system that the powers that be do not have control over. What ever regulations you think crypto should have, keep in mind you aren't the one writing the laws. The people who will decide what regulations will exist are politicians and the billionaires who bribe them. Neither of which have your best interest in mind.\n\nIf regulated markets are your cup of tea then go play with stocks. They already exist for all their pros and cons. Don't try and change an entire market just because you are someone who ignored the first rule of crypto and got burned, or you are just hoping regulation is going to pump your bags.\n\nDigital money, as opposed to money that is simply represented digitally, is a scary tool in the hands of the corrupt.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":8,"selftext":"# Reason of writing this post.\n\nCentralised crypto projects can create value for the global economy from tiny to quadrillion dollar markets, for countries but also for the individual and every layer in between. However there is something holding the space back.\n\nPonzi schemes, scams, rug pulls, fraud and malpractice are all too common withing the crypto space. Recently many of them have collapsed on themselves causing billions in damages and lost funds. This cannot continue in order to reach mass adoption. It is a shame this happened and has been happening for so long given how easy it is to prevent with minimal, rudimentary regulations. The world of traditional finance has seen these regulations implemented for decades and could not have grown as much without it. In order to let the space grow and discover new possibilities we need basic regulations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Disclaimer:***\n\nTo make the distinction between centralised and decentralised projects it becomes clear why decentralised projects are left out of the scope of this post.\n\nCentralised crypto projects can be thought of as a company leveraging blockchain and cryptocurrency technology for their business model. Because they operate in the breadth of sensitive data (money, information etc) they need trust in order to be of use.\n\nDecentralised crypto projects serve the purpose of creating an alternative to a central authority for permissionless networks that operate as true democracies through participation. With their open-sourced code and voting systems they need only the regulation they place upon themselves.\n\n# \n\n# The bull case for centralised crypto.\n\nA cryptocurrency is a little like a website. Everybody can make one in as little as 20 minutes. Therefore there are thousands of them and this number is growing every day. However, not everybody can as easily build a website that is as sizeable and established like Twitter or YouTube. Here too lies a parallel with crypto. A few of those thousands of crypto projects are legitimate businesses that are being or have been worked on for years by experienced developers. They leverage crypto and blockchain to create new or improved services. This is how they create value for their customers. Unlike easy to replicate crypto projects, the token or coin is not their product but is used as a tool on their platform to streamline their operation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Crypto has a faster adoption rate than the internet.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/eruet8c1gc1a1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9cd86ec7ff48e8d77450431b7145cbf7bfd4269)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is potentially a big future for crypto. There are many projects that create value by being faster, more energy efficient, more secure, immutable\/transparent, cheaper than their current implementations or even by offering completely new possibilities. In an interview at Converge 2022 Kevin O'Leary states he would save MILLIONS if he could use crypto. This goes for other businesses as well as countries, governments, individuals even banks can benefit as their costs could be significantly lowered with a blockchain infrastructure. Crypto has been mentioned as a serious interest in many reports from large and credible entities on every plateau just mentioned. Even from an environmental perspective there are solutions crypto offers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Future outlook is positive to very positive for all sections. ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/eylt2dq7gc1a1.png?width=918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e570521cfad7c19a0609ce4d44bd634ede65102)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Despite Risks, Crypto Love Keeps Growing in LATAM](https:\/\/nearshoreamericas.com\/latin-america-crypto\/)\n\n[The UN supports leveraging blockchain for land registry](https:\/\/www.un.org\/en\/delegate\/oict-supports-un-habitat-improve-urban-planning-technology)\n\n[Crypto Adoption in Africa - The Future Looks Bright](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/crypto-adoption-africa-future-looks-bright-dami-solebo\/)\n\n[SCALING ACCESS TO NEW AFRICAN MARKETS THROUGH PAYMENTS INFRASTRUCTURE](https:\/\/mfsafrica.com\/article\/7)\n\n[*MFS Africa*](https:\/\/mfsafrica.com\/) *has recently announced working with a centralised crypto company to make payments cheaper and faster for 400 million Africans in 35 countries.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are also plenty of fortune 500 companies working on leveraging crypto solutions for better efficiency or new possibilities and tons of research reports by institution like the BIS about the phenomenal growth of crypto.\n\nThere many use cases and utilities and more are being built and more will come. I would put some examples here but for the case of shilling I will not. The technology of crypto and the new possibilities and improved versions of already established possibilities is disruptive for the better.\n\n# \n\n# The big issue.\n\nIf it is so good why isn't used more?\n\nAt the time, there are basically no rules nor oversight. The space gets called \"The Wild West\" for a reason. Let's take a look at what has happened as a result of the lack of rules.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- Celsius Network:**\n\nA platform where users deposit their capital and others could borrow that capital. 80% of the revenue coming from interests paid on the loan goes to the users who provided the capital and 20% went to Celsius. This all sounds great and is a sustainable business model that benefits the users as well.\n\n[However, Celsius became insolvent.](https:\/\/pontem.network\/posts\/the-celsius-crash-explained)\n\n\"Celsius was explicitly not covered by \\[these\\] customer protection programs. So when crypto prices collapsed, just as happened to traditional markets in the 1920s and 1960s, there was no backstop and no protection. \"\n\nThey couldn't get coverage from customer protection programs because they weren't properly regulated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Celsius had been flagged repeatedly in the past for regulatory non-compliance, particularly in relation to its operation as an unlicensed and unregulated bank.\"\n\nEven though it was common knowledge they were non-compliant, no action could be taken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow did Celsius lose money to become insolvent?\n\n[\"The troubled crypto lending platform Celsius Network is reportedly using investor funds to conduct high-risk leveraged crypto trading activities.\"](https:\/\/www.livebetpro.com\/celsius-network-reportedly-used-customers-funds-to-trade-leading-to-a-loss-of-millions\/)\n\nThey were gambling with customers' funds who thought it was being lend out.\n\nIn other words, for a lack of any oversight they could A. do what they wanted and B. couldn't get standard customer protection so when it went wrong no one was safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- Terra Luna**\n\nTerra Luna offered a stablecoin called UST. -Pretty sure everyone knows what a stablecoin is around here but I'll explain anyway.- It is a token that follows the price of (in this case) the Dollar. You give them 1 Dollar and they give you 1 UST **and vice versa**. This is useful because stablecoins are easier and cheaper to move around.\n\nHere is where it gets iffy. To create demand for UST the Terra Luna team (Luna Foundation Guard), offered 20% interest in annuity to UST lenders. This was unsustainable and characteristic of a Ponzi scheme as it was a static interest and not a variable one (the amount of borrowers was in this case irrelevant to the interest pay out to lenders). Ponzi schemes are usually illegal but there is no one watching in crypto so why not.\n\nOn may 9 when UST fell to 86 cents and lost its peg, with Luna (their collateral coin) falling 43% LFG tweeted the following:\n\n\" \\[4\/\\] As a result, the LFG Council has voted to execute the following: - Loan $750M worth of BTC to OTC trading firms to help protect the UST peg. - Loan 750M UST to accumulate BTC as market conditions normalize.\"\n\n[Here is a full twitter thread with a timeline of the crash.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/jonwu_\/status\/1523793482850050048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1523793482850050048%7Ctwgr%5Eec7836033391e130a0edafb35001142fbf18162e%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.altcoinbuzz.io%2Fcryptocurrency-news%2Fa-timeline-of-the-terra-ust-de-pegging%2F)\n\nMeaning when it was time to pay back UST holders (remember with a stablecoin when you give them 1 dollar they give you 1 stablecoin and the other way around) they chose not to. They were sitting on BILLIONS and let it all crash instead of paying back their users' with the dollars they had previously swapped for UST. They tried to \"resolve\" it in more creative manners which again is characteristic of a Ponzi scheme. No oversight for this. The only way for investors to hopefully get justice is trough a class action lawsuit which should NOT be necessary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- FTX**\n\nFresh in our memories we probably all know what happened so I'll keep it short.\n\nFTX took users' funds and gave it to his partner to invest it back in FTT (FTX's token). This led their valuation to come close to that of the biggest crypto exchange even though they only had 3% the userbase. Users tried getting their funds out but because SBF (the owner of FTX) sold them to buy his own token (which was highly illiquid) they became insolvent.\n\nThe problem is that he could do with those funds as he wished (just like LFG and Celsius). Had the funds remained untouched on the platform he would have been solvent (but far less highly valued). So again, lack of oversight can be blamed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- Squid Game token**\n\nNot much needed to be said. Con artists took advantage of a hype around a popular show and named their token after the show even though it had nothing to do with the show or the creators of the show.\n\n[Multiple Squid Game token investors reportedly can\u2019t sell SQUID](https:\/\/finbold.com\/warning-multiple-squid-game-token-investors-reportedly-cant-sell-squid\/)\n\nPeople bought the token but could not sell them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Squid Game crypto token collapses in apparent scam](https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-59129466)\n\nWhile people were stuck with the tokens they had bought, the founders sold off their tokens on the open market. This is called a rug pull and is a blatant scam.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- Gravitoken**\n\n[https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/gravitoken\/](https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/gravitoken\/)\n\nGravitoken was one of the \"mathematically ever-rising\" cryptocurrencies. They supposedly used \"math\" to magically increase the price. This meant however that through impermanent loss (a technical term for losses you are exposed to as liquidity provider), users' funds were evaporated out of their wallets to increase the price. This was done through forced liquidity pool participation. You bought the tokens, paid a bunch of nonsense fees and had them forcibly stored in a liquidity pool of their own. The price went up but you lost the same amount in IL, combined with the fees upon purchase and sale you lost money. It was a scam.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of these examples could have easily been prevented with some vey simple regulations. It becomes obvious that when a single person or central party is in charge without any regulatory oversight it can easily come to malpractices and or fraud leading to bankruptcies and the loss of customer funds. This is why there needs to be a regulatory framework for centralised crypto projects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# To answer the question of why crypto isn't used more, would you?\n\nAfter the recent fiascos, would you as a business put your most sensitive data on a centralised chain? Would you trust your funds or savings on a centralised platform? Most likely not. That doesn't mean you can only use decentralised projects, centralised projects can create valuable services and platforms but not with (the possibility of) con artists running the show. There needs to be trust and the best kind of trust is an enforced one.\n\n[\"Nearly three in ten executives see blockchain regulations as the number one biggest barrier for the uptake of the technology\u2019s full potential.\"](https:\/\/www.statista.com\/chart\/17948\/worlwide-barriers-to-blockchain-adoption\/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Regulatory uncertainty is holding the technology back.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/osnlbrx8ic1a1.png?width=757&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90f67cd4af92d4fd464600dcd4b2dd419a6672dc)\n\nThis data is from 2018 but I can only imagine the issue of regulatory uncertainty becoming larger. Note that it says uncertainty, not impeding regulations. People just want certainty so they work with it.\n\n# \n\n# What is a solution to safely adopt this new technology?\n\nAs the space is still developing and figuring out what the possibilities are, a complicated framework at this time would do more harm than good. For example: prematurely labelling projects as a security could seriously impact their growth and path forward. However, some parts of it could be beneficial without impacting their growth.\n\nHere are some:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis section is about projects whose main source of income is the sale of their token.\n\n\\- Founders of a project with a considerable part of the total issued tokens should be open and transparent about their intentions of selling and buying these tokens.\n\n\\- Projects need to be open and transparent about pre-sales and -mines.\n\n\\- Projects can not intervene in regular transactions (Like freezing the option to sell your tokens).\n\n\\- Projects can not enforce the allocation of funds under normal circumstances (your keys your coins).\n\n\\- Projects need to be clear about their business model and monetization.\n\n\\- Projects can not imply the appreciation of their token if not bound to a monetization model. (Utility tokens)\n\n*This would help in preventing rug pulls and scams.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis section is about projects that have assets in custody or under management.\n\n\\- Projects need to be open and transparent about their reserves and have an obligation to protect customer funds through insurance or consumer protection programs.\n\n\\- Projects can not use customer funds for any investments unless licensed and agreed upon by customers.\n\n\\- Projects are responsible for funds in case of hacks\/breaches.\n\n\\- Projects are required to have a functional 24\/7 support .\n\n*This would help in preventing mismanagement or malpractice by custodians.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese type of regulations would only help crypto grow not impede the adoption.\n\nMore is needed but beginning with simple implementations of regulation that don't hinder growth but help the space grow safely and securely is a good start.\n\n*(I am no expert and am just trying to outline what is needed.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo conclude:\n\nThere is great value created by centralised crypto projects the global economy can benefit from. However given the sensitivity of the data they work with there needs to be trust in the centralised party. Therefore there needs to be regulatory oversight. Without it, you don't have any guarantees and as we can clearly see, the space is prone to malpractice and defrauders. This makes the technology impossible to work with or adopt.\n\nThere needs to be a regulatory framework that covers at least the most rudimentary of regulations in order for centralised projects to bring value to the world without impacting their growth or limiting their possibilities.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z15xa0\/why_centralised_crypto_needs_regulatory_oversight\/","author":"RookieRamen","num_comments":29,"created_utc":1669054734000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"\ud83d\udd34 UNRELIABLE SOURCE","title":"Why Centralised Crypto Needs Regulatory Oversight.","distinguished":null,"id":"z15xa0","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":38,"selftext":"There seems to be a lot of consensus that 12-14k is going to be the bottom for Bitcoin this cycle. To me, this means without a doubt it won't be the bottom. The way I see it, there really are only two sensible outcomes from here:\n\n1. We've weathered the worst of the storm, there is a lot of fear, but the FTX contagion is running out of gas and the market is going to stabilize where it is to form a bottom\n2. The worst is yet to come, further collapses of big players will lead to cascading effects that will push the price downwards well below \"technical targets\" of 12k -- possibly as low as 6k\n\nSo what? What to actually do in this situation?\n\nWell, the first thing to do is take stock of your situation. If you can't tolerate outcome 2) you need to rebalance your portfolio. De-risk by selling off some of your riskier coins (i.e pretty much anything that isn't Bitcoin).\n\nNext, mentally grapple with the possibility of 2). Imagine the loss like it already happened to you. Try to gauge whether you could actually handle this if it happens. If you don't think you could, go back to the previous step and de-risk more. I can't stress this enough, if\/when the final capitulation happens you have to steel yourself for it because despite all your diamond handed thoughts, you are going to *want to sell*. It sounds completely nuts, but I promise it will happen. It's called capitulation for a reason.\n\nOnce you've done that, assess whatever money you put aside from either de-risking above, a pre-existing DCA plan, disposable income, or whatever. Whatever amount it is, make sure it's something you can afford to lose. Remember the possibility of outcome 2). Plan to start averaging into the market from now for the next 4-8 weeks. The exact timing and amount can vary, just discipline your buys so you don't throw it all into the first big drop, this is the big rookie mistake. For example, put in 20% every 10% drop -- this is a plan that expects the price to drop no further than 50% from here (not unreasonable). Or just put 15% every week, until you run out. Whatever works for you.\n\nIf 1) plays out, then you'll miss the bottom, but overall this likely means you'll have lost only a few % as you averaged in to mitigate your risk -- this is *very* worth it, since risk levels are off the charts right now. If 2) plays out, then hopefully your strategy averages down far enough that your overall portfolio loss is tolerable. Any crypto portfolio that is -20% or higher in the depths of a bear market is a massive win in my opinion.\n\nFinally, assuming you haven't invested more than you can afford to lose, you'll come out of the other side of this bear market in great shape. This is something that has worked for me in the past, and I plan to do something similar again this time.\n\nWhy should you listen to me? You shouldn't. I'm some random person on reddit. Why are you even reading this? Come up with your own strategy.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z1mblb\/bear_market_strategy_for_first_timers\/","author":"technically_fruit","num_comments":62,"created_utc":1669098006000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"STRATEGY","title":"Bear market strategy for first timers","distinguished":null,"id":"z1mblb","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":21,"selftext":"After the FTX contagion, there has been a wave of people taking off their funds off CeX, storing them on cold wallets and **trading on DeX.**\n\nThough DeX is safer than CeX, there is one problem which is inherent to the design of DeX. Every on-chain trading always run into the risk of front running. There are bots deployed (as smart contracts) which will front run your trade. They are known as front running bots.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to share some information regarding the front-running bot. When I started writing the post, I realised that it will be better if I explain things in detail. So, first let's have a look at how DeX works, and then we will see in other part, why DeX, due to it's design runs into the problem of front-running bots.\n\nSo, let's start with how DeX functions:\n\nThe idea of a decentralized exchange is simple - allow users to trade their crypto directly on-chain through smart contracts without giving up control of their private keys.\n\nDeX requires Market makers (MM) for liquidity. Market Makers are entities that provide liquidity (assets) to trading markets. In non-orderbook systems, liquidity is what allows trading to be possible. That means if you want to sell BTC to buy ETH, the exchange must have an ETH balance you can purchase from in exchange for BTC. Some trading pairs have very high liquidity (eg. BTC &lt;&gt; ETH trading pair), but some have extremely low or no liquidity at all (eg. scam tokens, or newly created tokens).\n\nA DEX must have enough liquidity to function and serve as an alternative to centralized exchanges. DeXes are also known as Automatic Market makers (AMM). Any user can deposit funds to a specific trading pair and add liquidity, and in exchange earn money for doing so through trading fees taken from the users.\n\nNow, the DeX works on concept of ***x\\*y=k .*** \n\nAssume we have a trading pair for **ETH &lt;&gt; LW** Token\n\n* x = reserve balance of ETH in the trading pool\n* y = reserve balance of LW Token in the trading pool\n* k = a constant\n\nThis formula is responsible for calculating prices, deciding how much LW Token would be received in exchange for a certain amount of ETH, or vice versa.\n\nNow, if you swap LW for ETH in DeX, according to the equation, the price of LW will increase, while that of ETH will decrease (in term of other token)\n\nExample: Assume we have 100 ETH and 200 LW Token in the contract. What would happen if I want to swap 1 ETH for LW Tokens? Let's do the math.\n\n    \n    inputAmount = 1 ETH\n    inputReserve = 100 ETH\n    outputReserve = 200 LW3 Tokens\n    =&gt; outputAmount = 1.98019802 LW3 Tokens\n\nWhat would happen if instead I wanted to swap 2 LW3 Tokens for ETH?\n\n    inputAmount = 2 LW3 Tokens\n    inputReserve = 200 LW3 Tokens\n    outputReserve = 100 ETH\n    =&gt; outputAmount = 0.999 ETH\n\nThese amounts are very close to the 1:2 ratio of tokens present in the contract reserves, but slightly smaller. Why?\n\nEquation X\\*Y=K represents a Hyperbola, and hence, neither of the reserves will ever go to zero. The hyperbola never intersects at x=0 or y=0 - **This means that neither of the reserves will ever be 0 just as a product of trading! Reserves are infinite.**\n\n[https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/QfUkLVS](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/QfUkLVS)\n\n# SLIPPAGE\n\nSince we don't get tokens in the exact ratio of reserves, this leads to an interesting implication of the math. The price function causes **slippage** in the price.The bigger the amount of tokens being traded relative to their reserve values, the lower the price would be.\n\nLet's say I wanted to try to drain out the entire pool, and sell 200 ETH.\n\n    inputAmount = 200 ETH\n    inputReserve = 100 ETH\n    outputReserve = 200 LW3 Tokens\n    =&gt; outputAmount = 133.333 LW3 Tokens\n\nAs you can see, when we're trying to drain out the pool, we're only getting close to a half of what we expect.\n\nSome may see this as a flaw of automated market makers that follow x\\*y = k, but it's actually not. It is the same mechanism that protects pools from being completely drained. This also aligns with the law of supply and demand: the higher the demand relative to the supply, the more costly it is to buy that supply.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the next post, we are going to understand why the slippage results into peopel deploying Front-running bots, what happens to you when you trade and how to prevent or minimize the effect of front-running bot while trading on DeX.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z1mrea\/frontrunning_bots_in_dex_part1_how_dex_works\/","author":"yourmom_fat_as_hippo","num_comments":12,"created_utc":1669099601000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"FRONT-RUNNING BOTS in DEX: PART-1: How DeX works","distinguished":null,"id":"z1mrea","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":61,"selftext":"You want hopium? Here's some that may not feel like it, but amidst all the current uncertainty it qualifies. Do we know when the true bottom will be? No. Has it already arrived? Nobody can answer that with certainty so we dunno. \n\nHere's what we do know. Before FTX ever happened the crypto market had already fallen by over 2 trillion dollars. That's more than two thirds of the entire market wiped. We know this is due to the fed tightening monetary policy to fix inflation. A simplified way of explaining this is that in 2021 we had a massive bullrun that saw Btc go from under 10k to nearly 70k and it obviously dragged all the alt coins to the moon with it.\n\nThis was only possible because the money printer went brrrr and large institutions and hedge funds with billions of dollars could borrow money at an interest rate of 0-2%... This means they could play monopoly with billions of dollars. \n\nNow inflation needs to be brought down and speculative assets like crypto won't be attractive until the  inflation is brought much closer to 2%. The best part however is that there **WILL** be another bullrun, despite everyone telling you nobody knows. Ultra rich people will always wanna gamble, and once the technical recession is dealt with somewhere later into 2023 the money printer will once again brrr us to the moon. \n\nThe same people acting like we're in the great depression also won't tell you that billionaires move the market not average joes. Once conditions are favourable to take on debt again the bullrun will be back again and the next one will probably be the mother of them all because of regulations and such and crypto becoming a more entrenched idea.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z1olel\/a_hopium_tank_hooked_up_to_reality\/","author":"Socialinfluencing","num_comments":68,"created_utc":1669106557000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"SPECULATION","title":"A hopium tank hooked up to reality.","distinguished":null,"id":"z1olel","downs":null,"ups":null}

They would be providing an already functioning Fiat service with a massive amount of users, but also trust &amp; solvency way superior to what crypto exchanges have right now.\n\nThis event could turn Banks into CEX 2.0, working all-around for the investors who want lesser risks on their assets being stolen; for the Banks to gain control over the fees; and for the tax institutions to have an easier traceability on users.\n\nTrue advocates of decentralization and blockchain will always look for DEX or any \"peer-to-peer without a 3rd party\" option, but CEX exist for the whole reason of ease the adoption.

You can spoof token transfers on Explorers.\n\nThese are the hacker's real addresses, but these transfers are spoofed using a custom [spoofed token](https:\/\/medium.com\/etherscan-blog\/spoof-tokens-on-ethereum-c2ad882d9cf6) contract I created on the Sepolia testnet. They allow you to send from any address to any other address without needing those to be the 'msg.sender'. So the Explorer displays the transfers as coming from someone else's address.\n\nThe exploit uses a contract where the 'requires' statements that check for **approval\/allowance** are removed.\n\nThe fun part is that the hacker is stuck with these tokens (unless he figures out the ABI for the contract I used).\n\n## What you need to watch out for:\n\nOn a serious note, there is a second lesson that you need to be careful with token approvals. These contracts work because the token approval has been removed.\n\nAll of you are STILL using [**UNLIMITED approvals**](https:\/\/nova-explorer.arbitrum.io\/address\/0x0057Ac2d777797d31CD3f8f13bF5e927571D6Ad0) on your real MOON tokens on the Arbitrum Nova. This is not safe unless you absolutely trust the contract. And it's not hard to create bad contracts as I've just shown you. I could create a contract with good functions and a backdoor function. If you gave my swap contract unlimited approval, I could one day choose to trigger that backdoor function without your knowing.\n\nYou can use this [Token Approvals tool](https:\/\/nova.arbiscan.io\/tokenapprovalchecker) to check for your approvals on Arbitrum Nova.\n\nI find it a bit ironic that most of you think you're being safe by taking your tokens off exchanges, using self-custody, and saying things like \"NYKNYC\". But then you do unsafe things like unlimited approvals. Who knows if there's a major bug in the contract.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z20hrm\/evidence_that_ftx_accounts_drainer_is\/","author":"Maleficent_Plankton","num_comments":38,"created_utc":1669140648000,"edited":1669148450000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANALYSIS","title":"Evidence that FTX Accounts Drainer is transferring MOONs and BRICKs between his accounts.

I stop when they exit the top 10 excluding stable coins.\n\nNow to update where do I stand and what are the results up till now\n\nSo to measure performance, I will look at what this strategy has done compared to a lump sum investment at my starting point on the 15th of December.\n\nUPDATE\n\nMust admit I had FOMO...made a gamble on Luna....probably a stupid one.....I'll keep it and take it as a lesson learned.....Stick to the F$#@%$\\* plan!!!\n\nI have adjusted my strategy a bit. I am upping my investment in BTC and ETH compared to alts.\n\nUPDATE 19-9-2022\n\nHeavy on BTC and ETH.\n\nUPDATE 28-9-2022\n\nImplement flexible DCA day and time. When pump postpone DCA in bear market.\n\nUPDATE 7-10-2022\n\nStarting to look like a very good time to accumulate. Still wondering if there is going to be another drop. Hold off on DCA this week, due to unemployment rates release in the US today and FOMC minutes next week.\n\nUPDATE 29-10-2022\n\nAs Elon bought Twitter I acquired some additional DOGE....Small bet hoping to pay off.\n\nSo as you all can see some have worked out better then the others.\n\nBut IMO it is very interesting that we are in a downtrend combined with this strategy.\n\nWill try to keep you all updated once in a while on how it is performing.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z2k4zt\/fomc_minutes_today_my_journey_into_crypto\/","author":"rbepe","num_comments":35,"created_utc":1669193850000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"STRATEGY","title":"FOMC minutes TODAY! - My Journey into crypto","distinguished":null,"id":"z2k4zt","downs":null,"ups":null}

I know many people who lost money to the \"Big 3 Scams of 2022\" (Luna, Celsius, FTX) and I feel for anyone who trusted these \"projects\".\n\nHowever, some things need to break before something meaningful rises. Every time an implosion of this magnitude happens, people start becoming **more aware of risk management, security and \"doing this the right way\".** And yes, there is a right way in crypto and if you don't know what that is then you probably shouldn't put your money in anyway.\n\n1.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":110,"selftext":"**The latest detailed [Bankless episode](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IvAYINNcj50) is pretty brutal**. It says that the bulk of the 2021 Bull run was caused by a ponzi system created by the crypto hedge funds and yield farming protocols.\n\nIn the first 10 minutes, David straight up says that the 2021 price bull run was fueled by a giant ponzi scheme with all of DeFi and the minted shitcoins. This involved the crypto hedge funds, 3AC, Alameda, Genesis, all the CeFi companies offering interest, Yield Pools, FTX, ETH killers, and many more. His theory is that this was all fueled by CeFi lending, collaterallized loans, and other high-interest schemes.\n\nThis probably explains why David has been looking a lot more stressed in recent episodes.\n\n####**The Super cycles**\n\n- 2013-2014 bull market: caused by PoW copycats (OP: along with Mt. Gox and Silk Road)\n- 2016-2017 bull market: caused by ICOs\n- 2020-2021 bull market: caused by yield farming, which started with Compound in Dec 2020. This fed into the CeFi lending and all the crypto hedge funds. (OP: Retail also pumped a lot into both crypto and stock markets with funds from stimulus checks and quantitative easing.)\n\nThat was pretty brutal reveal, and it also might explain why David has been looking a lot more stressed in recent episodes. It's definitely a strong reverse of the typical Bankless pro-crypto stance.\n\n####**2020 to mid-2022: 3AC, DCG, Grayscale GBTC scheme explained**\n\nHere's my best summary. This probably isn't 100% accurate because there's so much info presented, and I don't understand every section of it:\n\n1. Gemini Earn borrows BTC from from retail customers, which then gets lent to Genesis\/DCG, which then gets lent to crypto hedge funds like 3AC\n1. DCG\/Genesis is the only company that can mint GBTC out of thin air\n1. Unlike retail customers, 3AC is able to acquire GBTC 1:1 for BTC. It trades its BTC for GBTC and begins selling GBTC, which at that time had a premium was worth way more than BTC. 3AC kept trading BTC for GBTC and then selling GBTC, which absolutely destroyed the value of GBTC. GBTC's premium quickly became a discount. That's pretty much how 3AC made all their money.\n1. With the discount, all GBTC holders are underwater compared to BTC, which is temporarily fine since BTC's value also went up. But once BTC's value falls, they're all way underwater.\n1. OP: In addition, there's currently a lot of speculation on whether it actually has enough BTC collateral. GBTC acts like a futures market. GBTC only needs to redeem the amount of BTC 6 months after the redemption request, so it doesn't necessarily have to hold BTC 1:1.\n1. 3AC then sold their profits and went into deep into investing into Ethereum killers like Avalanche, Solana, and Terra Luna. This whole time, their GBTC collateral is underwater compared to their BTC loans from Genesis.\n1. Jerome Powell begins raising interests, starting the collapse of the Bitcoin bull market. BTC and ETH fall 50% from their ATH at the start of the year.\n1. By Apr-May, the Terra Luna money making machine begins running out of steam. 3AC sells $1.5B worth of BTC for Terra's UST. Within a week, Terra's UST collapses, taking down half of the crypto hedge funds.\n1. 3AC goes down under, along with Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi. 3AC being looking for funds from anyone who would lend to them. Doesn't get it and gets liquidated. Fails.\n1. Genesis takes a big loss from their loan to 3AC but survive after getting bailed out from DCG.\n\nEveryone who expected more collateral to happen due to the Terra Luna\/Celsius contagion were right. It just took more months to fully-realize because companies were good at hiding it.\n\n####**Mid-2022 to now: FTX**\n\n1. The Terra Luna collapse is also likely when Alameda Research and FTX secretly went underwater.\n1. Alameda and FTX bail out BlockFi and Voyager with lines of credit (which we now know weren't backed by anything). This builds up a lot of false trust in FTX and Alameda as the good guys.\n1. FTX takes customer deposits over and over again to secretly bail out Alameda Research, which then gets sent to Genesis because Alameda Research had loans from Genesis.\n- FTX core members continue to gaslight the crypto community and hide their fraud\n1. FTX keeps afloat using their FTX shitcoins (FTT, SRM) as collateral. They manipulate the price and markets of their collateral by keeping the liquidity low while minting more out of thing air (through interest). The keep buying their shitcoins back to keep the prices up, and they're able to do this because they keep taking loans against these coins as collateral. That's a straight up Ponzi scheme because it's completely unsustainable.\n1. The rest is history that's been covered over and over this week.\n\nAt this point, Bankless temporarily puts on ther conspiracy hats starts wondering if the SEC knew about this ahead of time and just let the house of cards fall down on its own because that would've had a bigger effect.\n\n####**Further contagion**\n\n1. Genesis stops withdrawals and has a $1B hole. It announces it'll go bankrupt without additional line of credit. DCG also has a $1.1B promissory note to Genesis??\n1. DCG might go bankrupt. CZ takes a look and decides not to bail out DCG\/Genesis\/Grayscale.\n\n####**Their conclusion**\n\nThe bulk of the price action after Jan 2021 was caused by this giant interest lending system akin to a ponzi scheme","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z2ruei\/serious_latest_detailed_bankless_episode_most_of\/","author":"Maleficent_Plankton","num_comments":128,"created_utc":1669216904000,"edited":1669250544000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANALYSIS","title":"[SERIOUS] Latest detailed Bankless episode - Most of the 2021 Bull run was caused by a ponzi system created by the crypto hedge funds and yield farming protocols","distinguished":null,"id":"z2ruei","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":253,"selftext":"I will be trying my best to explain what happened yesterday in DeFi. It is extremely important to understand the risks in DeFi markets and possible exploits.\n\nHERE WE GO.\n\nYesterday DeFi markets had an irregular day, as the famous trader Avraham Eisenberg (Avi) known for very profitable trades, opened a massive $63M short for CRV Curve token on AAVE.\n\nIt did not go well.\n\nA bit about Avi first. He was the main character behind the mango market exploit a month ago.On the mango market exploit, he asserted that this was just the smart contract functioning as intended, so even though there is a bug in the smart contract, he made an argument that CODE IS LAW and hence, the treasure was his to keep, and do what he wants with. He tried to short USDT and GUSD with this massive stash, but to no success.\n\nShorting and longing using AAVE loans is normal in trading. However, what marks this event special, is that the size of the Avi's position ($63M) was oversized to the relatively illiquid CRV market.\n\nAAVE is an over-collateralised lending platform. For taking a short position, you deposit US dollars (USDC) and take out CRV. Then sell CRV to USDC, deposit it to AAVE, rinse and repeat.\n\nAvi is known to trade with \"size\" which means he does really big, and often risky trades. He \"telegraphs\" these trades publicly beforehand to make sure he gets the most attention (and likely copy trades).\n\nAvi is known to actively look for trades that can break the system because of lenient risk parameters. In trading, this means that the size of buy\/sell\/loan is so large that it starts to severely affect the underlying asset and market being traded.\n\nAvi opened $63M CRV short position on AAVE against 92m curve tokens (average price of 0.68 CRV\/USD)\n\nIt was suspected Avi was trying to break AAVE or was attempting to liquidate a large long CRV position He twitted just before the attack saying that he was going after a protocol in which the founder had put up nine figures for liquidation, seemingly referencing the juicy stack that Curve founder Mitch has put up for very low price of liquidation at around 36 cents of liquidation price, and as the battle went on, it went down further to 25 cents. Mitch was keeping an eye on his bags and keeping an eye on his bags, and keeping them fairly out of reach of liquidation. Mitch even went into Convex discord and started trash-talking.\n\nHowever, when people noticed the oversized position there is a chance for \"short squeeze,\" Avi's \"liquidation price\" is defined by the size of USDC collateral against his CRV loan. If the CRV price goes below this, the health ratio of the loan goes below 1.0.\n\nTo protect the system's integrity, unlike in traditional finance, AAVE will liquidate the collateral automatically and immediately with a \"margin call\". The short collateral (USDC) is traded and the proceedings from the sale are used to pay back (Avi's) loan to the creditors.\n\nBecause Avi is short, the USDC and CRV roles are reversed compared to what we usually understand as base and quote tokens in short trading.\n\nAvi borrowed CRV. In a liquidation, the collateral USDC is sold, or CRV bought, to make CRV creditors whole.When the loan gets liquidated, Avi will get to keep the $CRV though. However, because of the risk parameters, the collateral to loan is ratio is over-collateralised e.g. 120% USDC to 100% $CRV, buying CRV this way is cost inefficient.\n\nThere is another risk: What if the collateral, despite loan being overcollateralised, cannot be sold fast enough for good enough price to get $CRV to pay back AAVE creditors?\n\nIn this case what is called \"bad debt\" will be created.In AAVE, bad debt is ultimately paid by AAVE token stakes that will backstop the system.In a perfectly functioning system with good risk parameters, bad debt should never occur.However, in this case, Avi's position was oversized to the relatively illiquid underlying CRV market.\n\nThere was a risk that AAVE's automatic liquidation system cannot buy enough CRV to pay back Avi's $63M loaned CRV tokens, because there isn't simply enough liquidity at CRV markets.\n\nDoom loop:\n\n    Aave liquidation trades USDC to CRV -&gt; CRV price shoots up -&gt; Avi's loan health ration gets worse and worse -&gt; Overcollateral margin exceeded -&gt; Loan cannot be saved (unless liquidations are stopped and CRV price comes down)\n\nIn the bad debt scenario, AAVE token holders will pay.Staked AAVE would be liquidated to be used to buy CRV to fill the gap.\n\nThis is the \"systematic\" risk in DeFi. Something breaks at the critical markets and a large market end up with too much bad debt And this is exactly what happened with Mango Markets on Solana earlier. Their MNGO token lending pool risk parameters where lax, Avi could make a trade that flushed out all liquidity and Avi ended up with high profits.\n\n# HOW THE CRV SHORT DRAMA PLAYED OUT ?\n\nThe DeFi hold it together and this was a very, very, good stress test for the market ecosystem overall. When people noticed Avi's oversized CRV short positions, they rushed to buy CRV to squeeze him out. It was easy, because the position size was so large related to the market size.\n\nShort squeeze happens when trades\n\n1. realise everyone can profit on the expense of someone if they buy a bit more assets\n2. people target short sellers from irrational hate (see \/r\/WallStreetBets and GameStop saga)\n\nA normal trader would not do this kind of a trade, or would start to reduce their position if a liquidation risk raises but Avi is not normal, he is a man of his word, the slayer of ponzi tokens, a trader with size.\n\nAvi was liquidated. He ended up with $63M USDC lost and received 92m CRV tokens, worth $57M at today's price.Avi's assumed total on-chain positions were $100M.\n\nHowever despite scratching their head, even the smartest minds of the industry could not figure out how Avi could have profited from this trade.\n\nAAVE ended up with $1.3M in bad debt. A minuscule amount, but something was still little broken.AAVE can cover this much of bad debt from interest payments in a short period of time.The systematic risk realisation is thus avoided.\n\n    The fact that nothing broke yesterday reflects the health of good, transparent DeFi markets.\n    This is opposite to FTX, Celsius, Genesis, etc. TradFi lending markets.\n\nA lot of people made easy money by longing the CRV, creating a short squeeze, which liquidated Avi.\n\n    Also, the very fact that we can see AAVE's debt of $1.3mn on-chain, but we can't see $1.5-2bn of debts of FTX, Celsius is what is wrong with CeFi. \n\nSorry for the long post.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":4,"selftext":"While many have been quick to look into FTX and SBF as the source of controversy and rightfully so for the collapse of an exchange and one that was \"reputable\" at that there are always three sides to a story, one party, the other party's, and the truth. Recently, with everyone laser-focused on FTX I wanted to look at Binance and see what type of impact they had on this and any benefits, influence, or other things that could have come from this move. Again at the end of the day FTX and SBF shoulder the majority if not all the blame for what occurred at his companies that led to this mess but nonetheless here is what I have heard\/found. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs most know Binance was an initial investor in FTX when SBF decided to launch the exchange and was a shareholder until they were bought out for roughly [$2.1 billion in BUSD and FTX's token FTT](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2022\/nov\/11\/binance-ftx-collapse-cryptocurrency-exchange-changpeng-zhao). This removed CZ as a shareholder in the traditional sense but still had them heavily involved due to the amount of FTT they received as part of the deal. During the crypto event in Lisbon crypto new source, [CoinDesk](https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2022\/11\/02\/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet\/) released reports of FTX's sister company Alameda Research's balance sheet, and this caused the first wave in the market. In a move that might come back to haunt him, regulators are now investigating Binance and CZ CZ announced that Binance would liquidate their FTT tokens in part due to the report. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis announcement by CZ caused what any type of news like this would cause. A bank run on FTX as users scrambled to get their funds off it and even in the traditional finance world, this can lead to the biggest and most regulated companies and industry collapsing. In an effort to save his crumbling empire SBF turned to Binance and for give or take 12 hours it sounded like Binance would buy FTX and stave off a collapse. If you were asleep though you honestly might have just slept through the whole thing given how quickly it all transpired. Once it was clear Binance was out CZ started to really get pretty brave in his comments which are going to put him under increased scrutiny of regulators across the world. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of them might have not been made to elicit much of a reaction such as how SBF was [badmouthing Binance in DC](https:\/\/decrypt.co\/114974\/cz-says-sam-bankman-fried-was-badmouthing-binance-in-dc-but-they-werent-in-a-battle) but they definitely did not help him at all. He did not stop there though and has regularly used Twitter, which he help fund the Elon Musk purchase, as a way to communicate and spread his views. He continued to throw stones at people\/companies in the space including those that had [lost all their funds](https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/binance-s-cz-says-users-share-blame-for-placing-trust-in-ftx-should-take-responsibility) on FTX which isn't going to win you any fans even if you are right. Even with moves that one could argue are only to help the industry (the [Binance Recovery Fund](https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/binance-ceo-denies-report-firm-met-with-abu-dhabi-investors-for-crypto-recovery-fund) he says he is setting up) there are issues with where he might be getting the money from in the UAE and possibly other Middle Eastern Nations. While he has declined that this is the case it is still something that will raise red flags due to how the UAE is brought up as a place for 3AC and Do Kwan to go and \"start over\" with a clean slate. That was not what sent everything into hyperdrive though rather it was yesterday when he sent out a tweet that he quickly deleted targeting another competitor in Coinbase along with Grayscale Investments which is owned by Digital Currency Group.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis [tweet](https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2022\/11\/22\/binances-ceo-sows-doubt-in-crypto-rival-coinbase-and-digital-asset-manager-grayscale-then-backtracks\/) aimed at both Coinbase and Grayscale's Bitcoin holdings was the boldest of bold one could do. The reason why this was not the smartest comment in my eyes is that with these being two of the only companies publicly traded with this type of exposure to the space they are crazily over-regulated with regulators chomping at the bit to catch them slipping up in some way. What is worse is that it can come across as someone who is trying to destroy all the smaller competitors ie become a monopoly that the West hates and the crypto space most likely will not respond positively to. CZ quickly walked back what he said but at the end of the day, it is something that he has said and will not help him with regulators or crypto people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven today he has made news over [Binance.US launching a PAC](https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/policy\/2022\/11\/23\/binance-us-steps-into-national-politics-with-new-campaign-pac\/) (political action committee) to most likely fill the void of influence that FTX has left. I am sure more is going to come out over the next week and if not it will soon with CZ having been requested to testify before the House Financial Services Committee in December along with various other members of the crypto space to really explain themselves.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z2y2e0\/looking_at_binances_roleplace_in_the_ftx_fallout\/","author":"Status_Floor1746","num_comments":19,"created_utc":1669231584000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"Looking at Binance's Role\/Place in the FTX Fallout and Crypto Market as a Whole","distinguished":null,"id":"z2y2e0","downs":null,"ups":null}

Coinbase was not involved in procuring the participants.\n\n[https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/ru\/institutional\/research-insights\/resources\/education\/2022-institutional-investor-digital-assets-outlook-survey](https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/ru\/institutional\/research-insights\/resources\/education\/2022-institutional-investor-digital-assets-outlook-survey)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTldr: All in all pretty bullish. Institutions seem to expect the bear market to be staying around for a while. They are also very hesitant regarding the vague and uncertain regulatory climate. That said they still seem fairly positive on the future of crypto and are actively investing an holding crypto assets in their portfolios. They also strongly look toward crypto use cases. A fairly large portion seems interested in actively trading as well.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z31iy4\/coinbase_survey_shows_strong_very_institutional\/","author":"OneThatNoseOne","num_comments":21,"created_utc":1669239916000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANALYSIS","title":"Coinbase Survey Shows Strong Very Institutional Investment and Adoption In 2022.","distinguished":null,"id":"z31iy4","downs":null,"ups":null}

Really interesting perspective.\n\nFTX bankruptcy destroy butters core assumptions:\n\n1. Butters like to explain that people demand \"decentralization\". Yet, the commercial success of the hypercentralized FTX before its fall shows that people couldn't care less about decentralization.\n\nThis point is obviously exaggerated, but holds some water as well. People, get your crypto off exchanges! Decentralization truly is one of the founding principles of crypto. It\u2019s been fun to see the mass exodus of late from CEXs. \n\n2. Butters keep talking about insane \"market cap\" of this new \"asset class\". Yet, tokens with billions dollars of \"market cap\" are actually worthless as shown by FTT plumetting from 3+Bn \"market cap\" to zero in one week.\n\nObviously another exaggeration, but I don\u2019t quite see what the core argument is here either? That we use market caps? Dunno what OP was meaning here. Feel free to comment!\n\n3. Butters promote a free-for-all unregulated environment. Yet, they are begging the SEC to send SBF to jail.\n\nThis is also an interesting point. This sub is always calling for SBF\u2019s and Kwon\u2019s heads, relying on centralized figures to enforce laws or the like. While this is using centralization of law enforcement to debunk crypto, crypto isn\u2019t about total decentralization: that\u2019s anarchy and we know that doesn\u2019t work.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":28,"selftext":"Hello people. In the wake of FTX contagion, A lot of people are opting to have a control of their own crypto. They want to use a crypto wallet, but they are confused about its functioning, and security threats. Here, in this **series of posts**, we will be discussing everything you need to know about blockchain wallet. I will be trying to explain everything in a bit detail from post-2. \n\nThis post is just an overview about general ideas of crypto wallet.\n\nA crypto wallet is a digital or software-based way to access your cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe purpose of a crypto wallet is to allow users to interact with the blockchain, either using software or a specialized hardware device. The name wallet is perhaps a bit of a misnomer, considering they aren\u2019t actually used to hold cryptocurrency. Instead, wallets serve as an intermediary between a user and their holdings, which \u201clive\u201d on the blockchain.\n\nUnlike a regular wallet, a crypto wallet doesn\u2019t actually hold your assets. Instead, it stores credentials called private keys that give you access to your assets on the blockchain.\n\n# Public key and private key.\n\nCrypto wallets all begin with a private key, a long, randomized string of letters and numbers. These private keys can also take the form of a QR code or mnemonic phrase.\n\nThis private key is used to generate a public key through an encryption process. While it\u2019s easy to verify that a specific private and public key fit together as a pair, you can\u2019t \u201cwork backwards\u201d and figure out a private key from its public key.This \u201cone-way\u201d \u2014 or \u201ctrap-door\u201d \u2014 encryption, makes it possible to share a public key without worry that someone will figure out your private key and steal your crypto.\n\nNext, the public key undergoes a mathematical function that \u201ccompresses\u201d it into a receiving address (either a QR code or a shorter string of numbers and letters) where you can actually send crypto.\n\nYou can generate many public keys \u2014 each with their own separate receiving address \u2014 from one private key. (It is a good security practice to change your public key from time to time).A public key has to be shared with people who wish to transfer your crypto.\n\n# How does a crypto transaction actually occur?\n\nWhen a person sends you crypto, he will include the private key of his Bitcoins and the public key of your wallet. Thereafter transactions can be completed and new Bitcoins can reach your account.\n\nWhen you spend some Bitcoins from your wallet, you are essentially signing off their ownership to the other person. For doing this, the private key of your Bitcoins must match the public address of the receiver. Then only, Bitcoins are transferred and your wallet balance reduces. The whole transaction is encrypted and added to the relevant blockchain and wallet balances of the two involved parties show changes.\n\n# Types of crypto wallets:\n\nThere are two main types of crypto wallets: **custodial and non-custodial.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1. custodial crypto wallet:**\n\nCustodial wallets are like bank accounts.\n\nThey are managed by a third party, which could be an exchange, a company, or even just another crypto user. These wallets are convenient because you don\u2019t have to worry about losing your private keys or managing them yourself.\n\nHowever, custodial wallets come with risks. Because a third party manages your crypto, they also control your crypto keys. This means that if the company goes out of business or is hacked &gt;!OR GAMBLES WITH YOUR FUNDS!&lt;; your crypto could be at risk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. Non-custodial wallet:**\n\nNon-custodial wallets are the opposite of custodial wallets.\n\nWith a non-custodial wallet, you are the only one who has access to your private keys. This might sound like a recipe for disaster (after all, if you lose your keys, you lose your crypto), but non-custodial wallets actually offer two big advantages.\n\n1. Because you are the only one who has access to your private keys, non-custodial wallets are much more secure than custodial wallets.\n2. Non-custodial wallets give you full control of your crypto. This means that you can use your crypto however you want, without having to worry about third-party restrictions.\n\nNon-custodial wallets can be further classified into two types: SOFTWARE and HARDWARE wallets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(i) HOT WALLETS (SOFTWARE WALLETS):**\n\nA software wallet is a piece of software that stores your private keys digitally within the software -normally on your computer or phone. These wallets are also known as hot wallets. You can install a software wallet on your mobile device, PC, or laptop.  Software wallets tend to be very easy to use: since the wallet is online within your device, you can access it instantly. This makes them very attractive for beginners.\n\nHowever, there are also a few drawbacks. Any device connected to the internet is vulnerable to hacks deployed through the internet connection. In other words, your private keys can be targeted if you are using a hot wallet on your phone or computer.\n\nSo although hot wallets are a very convenient means of storing your private keys, they can never fully secure them from online threats and hacks.\n\n**1. Desktop wallets:**\n\nThese are software programs that can be downloaded to a laptop or PC. These wallets work even when not connected to the net.\n\n**2. Mobile wallets:**\n\nSince handheld mobile devices are very popular, there are compatible mobile wallets available. Apart from their obvious portability, they have QR code compatibility that makes instant digital payments a breeze.\n\n**3. Online web wallets:**\n\nOnline web wallets are maintained on the cloud by third parties. They require internet connectivity to work. Since private keys of these wallets are accessible via the cloud, online web wallets are the least secure choice. But large institutions that have multiple co-signatories for a wallet prefer these types of wallets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(ii) COLD WALLETS:**\n\nThose who would rather take charge of their own account security generally opt for a cold wallet. The two most popular types of cold wallets, hardware and paper, fall on opposite sides of the technology gamut. Paper wallets are about as low-tech a solution as you can get, while hardware wallets often contain sophisticated high-tech components. Both are considered a highly secure way of securing your crypto.\n\n**1. Paper wallets:**\n\nAs discussed, paper wallets store the private key and public address in QR form. This information can be printed out and sealed for greater safety. Paper wallets, though safe, are often prone to humidity and fire hazards.\n\n**2. Hardware wallets:**\n\nOn the other hand, a hardware wallet is a physical device that stores your private keys in an isolated environment.  The advantage of using a hardware wallet is that it operates in an offline environment, away from the internet and its associated threats.\n\nHowever, hardware wallets can be less convenient in terms of accessibility, since you need to physically approve transactions each time you interact. Nonetheless, when compared to software wallets, they provide a far greater level of security since they cannot be hacked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the next post, We are going to go into detail about HARDWARE WALLETS and difference between single-currency and multi-currency wallets, and also, difference between seed phrase and private keys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z3e86b\/crypto_wallets_101_part1_private_keys_what_is_a\/","author":"yourmom_fat_as_hippo","num_comments":16,"created_utc":1669277230000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"CRYPTO WALLETS 101: PART-1: private keys, What is a crypto wallet and their types.","distinguished":null,"id":"z3e86b","downs":null,"ups":null}

I detailed a number of issues regarding its very unsuccessful launch. One thing mentioned was its heavy investment from FTX. \n\nWe know that the blockchain really was not ready to launch - the failed NFT mints, tokenomics schedule not published, and poor TPS levels etc\u2026 \n\nNow that we've seen what was really happening at FTX, I've got a new theory on why the Aptos launch was a dismal failure. And this is absolute speculation. No evidence. Take with lots of grains of salt. \n\nSo now I think FTX forced them to launch in the hope that the value of the chain would go up and they could use it to hide some of their collateral losses on FTT. Maybe they thought they could possibly get away with it for another year. \n\nThe fact that the tokenomics were so difficult to come by leading up to the launch suggests two things to me - they weren't actually confirmed yet.

To prove this statement is not true, we need only look at the data CMC presents.\n\nLooking at the exchange data, this is the top 3 exchanges.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CMC Exchange Rankings](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/tvsf58dflv1a1.png?width=1221&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9355e91d3b0cc2d73e8609630efa38efd9b9914)\n\nBinance has been at the top of this list for YEARS. Their score of 9.9 has never dropped. And other exchange lag behind Binance by almost *TWO WHOLE POINTS*. This has been the structure of the list for years. Even FTX was ranked at around 8(didn't prove to be worth much anyhow). My point is here we see how Binance manipulates the data to have their exchange far above the competition with a score of 9.9 that indicates near perfection which we all know is not true.\n\nAlso, they choose to rank the exchanges based on criteria that HEAVILY favours Binance. Binance ranks exchanges on these four criteria.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zgchgnjvmv1a1.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a480b66033d904a143484a77401990449d2097da\n\nWe can certainly see how the first three heavily favour Binance.

Nobody here cannot tell me this is not an absolutely terrible and extremely biased way of ranking. What is worse is Binance has been found many times to  [operate in jurisdictions without licenses](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/binance-became-the-biggest-cryptocurrency-exchange-without-licenses-or-headquarters-thats-coming-to-an-end-11636640029), in at least a dozen countries according to WSJ  for which they have quite a number of cases against them as there were also reports of them trying [to illegally get around](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/investigates\/special-report\/fintech-crypto-binance-zhao\/) US securities laws and regulations. I mean to say that they \"cheated\" their way to the top to gain a wide market share and now is using that factor to manipulate a \"trusted\" web resource to raise their ranking. Think about all those new to crypto who may go to CMC for information and they all see Binance far and away at the top with a 9.9 score; think about how heavily that may influence their decision of which exchange to use.\n\nJust prior to Binance buying CMC, Binance was ranked 14th in early April 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CMC Exchange Ranking just before Binance acquires CMC](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6ixs2l29lw1a1.png?width=1221&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=214170cbada7fbcb832a6d705123e11a59d82d45)\n\n*SoMEhOw,* a month after the deal in May, CMC was ranked **first** after instituting the same \"Web Traffic Score\". As far as I can tell, Binance has never fallen from 1st rank since CMC was acquired by Binance.

What is stopping them from \"influencing\" the price and price changes of their own tokens like BNB and perhaps even BUSD(to prevent depegs\/stifle stablecoin competition). On this point while anecdotal, I visit CMC a lot and have noticed BNB's price often seems *slightly* higher than on other exchanges &amp; aggregators as well as BNB almost always perform better than other stablecoins tho this *could* be coincidental. \n\nWhat also stops them from manipulating tokens of other competing firms\/projects. They also rank all tokens, so why not manipulate that the way the exchange rankings are manipulated.  We have all seen that it doesn't even take much, just a nudge in the right direction to cause a complete market collapse or even a full-on market pump, even if it is based on false or shaky information. We know that Binance now owns the largest reserves of Bitcoin, so what stops them from manipulating that, to maybe cause a pump and then sell some reserves for profit. \n\nI can go on and on with this but I hope by now we get the point.\n\nTldr: don't trust Coinmarketcap data as it is some of it is certainly manipulated by Binance if not much of it.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z3lseo\/you_should_not_trust_coinmarketcap_for_accurate\/","author":"OneThatNoseOne","num_comments":163,"created_utc":1669301222000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANALYSIS","title":"You Should Not Trust Coinmarketcap For Accurate Information and DYOR.

CZ himself afterwards confirmed that this news was false.\n\n\n- CZ also himself saying that Coinbase does not have enough reserves. Just to delete his tweet afterwards as Coinbase laid out that they have 2M BTC right now. Which is also way more than Binance even though binance is the biggest exchange.\n\nI think the point is clear.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":115,"selftext":"Some of you may not know, but Binance owns CoinMarketCap (CMC). And the platform recently released what it [calls](https:\/\/twitter.com\/CoinMarketCap\/status\/1594955634587611136) a \"Proof of Reserves\" feature. But, interestingly, CMC has used the new feature launch to inaccurately portray that Binance has provided Proof of Reserves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What is Proof of Reserves?\n\nFirst off, let's get a (brief) understanding of what Proof of Reserves actually is. Note that there is no one standard way to conduct PoR. However, Nic Carter, one of the co-founders of Coin Metrics, a crypto analytics firm, has been discussing Proof of Reserves for several years.\n\nOn his [website](https:\/\/niccarter.info\/proof-of-reserves\/), Nic Carter introduces PoR as:\n\n&gt;Proof of Reserves is the idea that custodial businesses holding cryptocurrency should create public facing attestations as to their reserves, matched up with a proof of user balances (liabilities). The equation is simple (in theory):  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Proof of Reserves + Proof of Liability = Proof of Solvency*\n\nI recommend you read the entire page if you have time, lots of great info in there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Binance's PoR promises + wallet disclosure\n\nFollowing the FTX collapse, the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), [promised to produce Proof of Reserves](https:\/\/twitter.com\/cz_binance\/status\/1590055819416330240) in a Nov 8 tweet. A few days later, Binance [publicly revealed](https:\/\/www.binance.com\/en\/blog\/community\/our-commitment-to-transparency-2895840147147652626) its hot and cold wallets. Note that Binance did not provide proof of user balances (liabilities), just a public disclosure of the wallets they control.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# CMC (Binance) misleads about PoR\n\nSo (as of Nov 24), Binance has not produced Proof of Reserves. Despite this, CoinMarketCap (owned by Binance) went ahead and used Binance as an example for Proof of Reserves.\n\n[https:\/\/twitter.com\/CoinMarketCap\/status\/1594993576420970496](https:\/\/twitter.com\/CoinMarketCap\/status\/1594993576420970496)\n\n&gt;Check out this **example of PoR data shown for** **#Binance** **exchange** \n\nWhat's more, CoinMarketCap is misleading CMC users as to what PoR is. The entire feature is being branded as a PoR feature everywhere except where the feature exists. Meanwhile, the PoR checkmark is being given to exchanges who have not even produced a real PoR attestation. Note that CMC doesn't even label the checkmark as PoR in its [user interface](https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/rankings\/exchanges\/) or on [exchange pages](https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/exchanges\/binance\/).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w6cc0ky4iz1a1.png?width=367&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46386dc38da455012158147d4b43e2cc06e6df19\n\nBut, CMC is quick to describe the feature as PoR on its [website](https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/alexandria\/article\/cmc-launches-proof-of-reserves) and [Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/CoinMarketCap\/status\/1594955634587611136).\n\n&gt;With this need for transparency in mind, CoinMarketCap is now **showing crypto exchanges\u2019 proof-of-reserves on our ranking pages**...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You can see we have added a \u201creserves\u201d icon right besides the exchanges. **If an exchange has an icon, it means that they support proof-of-reserves right now**...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Maybe they are mixing up terms?\n\nHere's a [ PoR info page provided by CoinMarketCap](https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/alexandria\/glossary\/proof-of-reserves-por), which appears to have remoulded the definition of PoR from Nic Carter's website to fit CoinMarketCap's \/ Binance's narrative.\n\n&gt;Proof of Reserves (PoR) is a method using cryptographic verification to demonstrate possession of digital assets...\n\nThey seem to have vaguely redefined and remoulded what Nic Carter, one of the go-to sources for PoR discussions, wrote on his website. CMC says PoR is used \"to demonstrate their solvency\" but includes no mention of liabilities when introducing what PoR is.\n\nIronically, also on the page is Nic Carter's list of exchanges that voluntarily provided PoR. Down near the bottom of the list is Binance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\\\\\"proof of assets\\\\\"](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/e056ivd2lz1a1.png?width=689&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56408ee73edfea3197866f241a9a3353b0e8ecee)\n\nSo, CoinMarketCap (again, owned by Binance) doesn't even list Binance as having produced Proof of Reserves on this page, just **Proof of Assets with no liabilities**. Meanwhile, on Twitter, [CZ has already said](https:\/\/twitter.com\/cz_binance\/status\/1590694652088582144) that the wallets were released while they wait \"for the proof-of-reserves to finish.\" Similarly, this is how it was [described on binance.com](https:\/\/www.binance.com\/en\/blog\/community\/our-commitment-to-transparency-2895840147147652626).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Success!\n\nThe media has already [eaten this up](https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/coinmarketcap-launches-proof-of-reserve-tracker-for-crypto-exchanges), also referring to it as a Proof of Reserves tracker or feature. Did journalists not look beyond the branding and launch publicity to see what the feature actually is? Are they just using PoR as a blanket term for any exchange that discloses their wallet address? Because some of CMC's \"checkmarked\" exchanges haven't actually provided PoR, including Binance. They have just disclosed wallet addresses with no form of real-time monitoring, external auditor, Merkle tree, or proof of liabilities.\n\nFurther, several exchanges that have *actually* provided PoR are omitted. Take Kraken, for example, which provided a form of auditor-assisted PoR with Merkle tree verification once in 2020 and again this year. The exact method Binance has been talking about. No checkmark. Even when this feature launched two days ago (Nov 22), the other exchanges all had the [checkmark out the door](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20221122110623\/https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/rankings\/exchanges\/), but not those who were ahead of the game (Kraken, BitMex, Gate.io).\n\nNow, in comparison, CoinGecko (not owned by any exchange) [released](https:\/\/twitter.com\/coingecko\/status\/1592493513240821760) a similar feature but actually includes details about each exchange's reserves info and is not blanket-labelling exchanges (i.e. Binance) as an example of having produced PoR, just \"exchange reserves.\"\n\nCoinGecko [definition](https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/learn\/what-is-proof-of-reserves-por) of PoR:\n\n&gt;PoR demonstrates an institution \/ exchange\u2019s ability to honor withdrawals from its platform at all times.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":2,"selftext":"Just thought id share some fun CT gossip with yall.\n\nThere\u2019s been some allegations that FTX actually had a huge role in blowing down the Celsius house of cards. What was it that caused the Celsius FUD? It wasnt long after LUNA collapsed, but Celsius actually *liquidated* their position in LUNA as the peg began to slip, escaping with close to 97 cents on the dollar. There were some losses but not enough to do the damage people thought (approx $15M this was discussed in bankruptcy court).\n\nWhat these FTX whistleblowers said was that apparently SBF had notified other major CEXs\/orgs with LUNA positions to **not** liquidate their positions and that they should defend the peg. Due to prisoner\u2019s dilemma and the fact they were already deep in the hole, Celsius liquidated their position much to the dismay of SBF who we now know had big exposure to LUNA\/3AC\/Genesis to the tune of billions of dollars (Genesis alone 1.5B). SBF is already known to dislike Mashinsky, and he definitely doesnt after this.\n\nAfter that FTX took a large position in stETH, which we know Celsius loved as a source of yield for their ETH deposits and by extension their customers. FTX started a mass sell-off of stETH which caused a depeg and put Celsius in hot water, after seeing the UST depeg prisoner\u2019s dilemma gets worse for everyone and stETH slips by a big chunk. Hindsight is 20\/20, but the Merge announcement ended up repegging stETH to basically 1:1.\n\nLUNA and stETH threw some haymakers but Celsius couldnt survive the FUD and saw hundreds of millions of dollars withdrawn in a matter of days, as well as CEL tanking. Fade to black, curtain on Celsius. Alameda starts *naked shorting* (selling assets not confirmed to be in possession) CEL on FTX to twist the knife and potentially cover some losses for themselves. The irony is that the \u201cCEL short squeeze\u201d was a massive blow to FTX who had a big short position on tokens they didnt have. At one point offering **2600% APY** for anyone who could lend CEL to close their short. So FTX is now desperate for CEL, with most locked up in Celsius treasury shorters have no choice but to buy a highly illiquid shitcoin on top of CEL apes resulting in a huge jump in CEL and smashing through their own liquidation prices. \n\nTheres more on this but the TLDR of it is FTX got pissed at Celsius for a big role in UST death spiral and then tried to get revenge and got Melvin Capital\u2019d by a crummy exchange shitcoin (aside from their own).","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z4169e\/the_alamedacelsius_lovers_quarrel\/","author":"marsangelo","num_comments":13,"created_utc":1669342451000,"edited":1669343992000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"The Alameda-Celsius Lover\u2019s Quarrel","distinguished":null,"id":"z4169e","downs":null,"ups":null}

They want to use a crypto wallet, but they are confused about its functioning, and security threats.\n\nSo, I decided to write a series of posts regarding these topics. This post is part-2 of the series. I would emphasize to go through part-1 too, for getting a clear idea in this post. I will link it down here for your convenience.\n\n[https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z3e86b\/crypto\\_wallets\\_101\\_part1\\_private\\_keys\\_what\\_is\\_a\/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z3e86b\/crypto_wallets_101_part1_private_keys_what_is_a\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nA lot of people seem confused about the difference between private key and seed phrase.\n\nI will try to explain both of these terms in detail, and finally explain the term \u2018YOUR SEED PHRASE IS YOUR WALLET\u2019.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Private Key:\n\nA private key gives you the ability to prove ownership or spend the funds associated with your public address. **Public-key cryptography (PKC)** is a technology often used to validate the authenticity of data using asymmetric encryption. A public key allows you to receive crypto-currency transactions. It\u2019s a cryptographic code that\u2019s paired to a private key. Private keys are the central element of crypto ownership. Blockchain is a digital storage network, and having the private key for a given blockchain address means that you control everything at that address.\n\nSo, you can think of private key as a password that allows you to access and manage your crypto funds stored on a blockchain. You can think of the private key as a password that unlocks the virtual vault that holds your money. As long as you \u2014 and only you \u2014 have access to your private key, your funds are safe and can be managed anywhere in the world with an internet connection.\n\nThere will be a separate private key for every different blockchain. So, if you have BTC, ETH and ADA in your wallet, you will have three separate private keys.\n\nNow, we will be moving towards seed phrase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Seed-phrase (recovery phrase):\n\nThe recovery phrase \u2013 sometimes called the seed phrase or mnemonic phrase \u2013 is a 12, 18, or 24-word pattern generated each time a new wallet is created. Unlike your private key, which relates to just one blockchain address, the recovery phrase is a derivative of your entire wallet, and all private keys stored there.\n\nBasically, in layman\u2019s terms, a recover phrase is the \u201cmaster key\u201d for all of your crypto accounts \u2013 it is your private keys in mnemonic form. These words, when entered into another crypto wallet (in the correct order) will recover all of the private keys you were storing on your original wallet.\n\nYou can visualize the difference between seed phrase and private key by simply considering this example.\n\nConsider a home which has three rooms. Each room has 1 crypto coin inside it. We will consider BTC, ETH and ADA. So, room1 has BTC, room2 has ETH and room3 has ADA. Now, you can enter the rooms and manage your coins using a key. So, you must have three keys for accessing all the coins. The problem with these keys is, they are too big to carry, and there are chances that you may lose them.\n\nNow, you can either have these 3 keys along with you, or you can create a vault, in which you can store these keys. This vault is secured by a separate key, which is small to carry and single key ensures that you don\u2019t have multiple keys to carry.\n\nNow, in this example, the home represents your wallet. The number of rooms represents the number of different coins (on different blockchain) you have in your wallet. The individual big keys represent the private keys, while the master key (vault key) represents the seed phrase.\n\n**AT THIS POINT, IT BEGS TO MENTION. DON\u2019T GIVE YOUR SEED PHRASE TO ANYONE. KEEP IT OFFLINE.** Seed-phrase are more riskier than private key, as in, if someone has your private key, you only lose funds of that blockchain; but if someone has access to your seed-phrase, you will lose all your funds from every blockchain.\n\nPrivate keys are long and complicated. It is a string of 256 alphanumeric characters. So, it\u2019s difficult to remember and handle. The seed phrase, on the other hand is made out of 2048 words (explained ahead) and hence, it becomes easy to handle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# YOUR SEED PHRASE IS YOUR WALLET.\n\nA lot of people fail to understand the above sentence completely. As explained in the part-1 of the post series, we understood that crypto wallets, unlike regular FIAT wallets, don\u2019t hold your coins or funds. **Your wallet only holds the private keys** (as explained in the example above).\n\nThe vault in the above example doesn\u2019t hold your coins, but it rather holds the keys that will give access to your coins in the rooms.\n\nNow, if you have lost your wallet, or you want to move from one wallet to another, you can simply import your old wallet into new one by using recovery (seed phrase).\n\nA **Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP)** is a formal proposal to change Bitcoin. BIP39 is a standard that proposed utilizing a mnemonic phrase -- a group of easy to remember words -- to serve as a back up to recover your wallet and coins in the event your wallet becomes lost or destroyed. This is also known as a seed phrase, recovery phrase, wallet back up, etc.\n\nSo, the usage of seed phrase to back up and recover your wallet was done in BIP39. Seed phrase serve as a recovery method in the event your wallet breaks or stops working.\n\nSo, you can import an existing wallet into new one. The only thing to make sure is, your new wallet should support same BIP standards as the existing wallet.\n\nIn addition, you should also write down the BIP standards that your wallet supports when storing your coins. These standards are called derivation paths and are a \"map\" telling your wallet where to find your coins. They are described in BIP44, BIP49, and BIP84.\n\nYour 12-24 phrase can be entered into any other wallet using the same structure\/format standard (BIP39), derivation path, and coin support to access your coins (by you or anyone else). The words in your mnemonic phrase aren't just any random words. They are pulled from a specific list of 2048 words known as the BIP39 word-list. Upon start up, wallets that utilize the BIP39 standard will provide you a 12-24 word phrase randomly chosen from the standard BIP39 word-list.\n\nWhat constitutes a \"good wallet\" is one that has clear, easy to access documentation on supported BIP standards, derivation paths, and recovery processes. This allows the user to successfully recover their funds on a different wallet in the event of discontinued support or become obsolete.\n\nThis website has provided the list of wallets and their supporting BIP standards: [https:\/\/www.blockplate.com\/blogs\/blockplate\/list-of-bip39-wallets-mnemonic-seed](https:\/\/www.blockplate.com\/blogs\/blockplate\/list-of-bip39-wallets-mnemonic-seed)\n\nMostly, all well-known wallets like Trezor, Ledger, Metamask, Exodus, Trust wallet etc support all the above mentioned BIP standards, and hence, you can always import from one wallet to another.\n\nSo, you may think that: If you are recovering an existing wallet, the wallet's software will ask you if you have an existing phrase or have the option to import one. You'll enter in your existing mnemonic seed phrase and bang, your coins are recovered, right?\n\nMostly yes, but only if the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  Both (new and existing) wallets should support BIP39\n2.  Both wallets should support the same derivation path (any one from BIP44, BIP49 or BIP84)\n3. New wallet should support the coins from old wallet.\n\nRegarding point 1 and 2, all the mentioned standards are supported by all well-known wallets. So, that shouldn\u2019t be the issue. Regarding 3, your coins won\u2019t get lost anywhere, but they won\u2019t show in the new wallet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wrote this post, as I have seen a lot of people got confused between seed-phrase and private keys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBe safe. Take control of your funds. **Not Your Keys, Not Your Cheese. The offline key is the only key.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you. You can ask me if you have any difficulties regarding the topic.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z48qo5\/crypto_wallets_101_part2_difference_between\/","author":"yourmom_fat_as_hippo","num_comments":21,"created_utc":1669367057000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"CRYPTO WALLETS 101: PART-2: Difference between private-key and seed-phrase, and explaining the statement 'Your Seed-Phrase is your wallet'","distinguished":null,"id":"z48qo5","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":647,"selftext":"I've been around crypto since before exchanges with tokens existed.  I wouldn't trust any of these new exchanges with a single penny.\n\nFTX has shown that the BTC, ETH, etc you think you bought with them is simply stolen from you.  They took your money and bought their own vaporware tokens instead.  It's obvious with FTX now, but other exchanges are still doing similar things to you still.\n\nA physical analogy:  Imagine storing your physical gold in a bank which has a built in tunnel going from the vault to the bank managers house.  And rather than a pile of gold in a vault there is a cardboard cutout with a picture that says \"your gold here\".  They super pinky promise they don't use that tunnel ever though and it's just for safety purposes. \n\nBut somehow, the bankman seems to be handing out gold like hotcakes from their house. There's some cover story of he's a successful trader or exchanger or something... but they give gold out to friends and use it to invest in businesses that somehow wildly also become instant successes...  despite being seemingly obvious copies of other companies and providing no real innovation. In fact it's such a good situation that this bank will even give you a great deal for depositing your gold in their bank.  Your cardboard cutoff will grow at some unsustainable rate and you'll feel rich.  \n\nWould you be comfortable using this bank to hold your gold?  \n\nA token is an extreme conflict of interest for any exchange.  It's the tunnel to the bankman's house.  They may tell you they aren't using it... but why is gold overflowing from their house?  \n\nAnd you say,  \"Look how rich the guy is!  He must be trustworthy.\" Well he got that money by taking it from you, whether you know it or not.  It's not like he's some great cryptocurrency innovator.  A lot of these guys don't even understand the very basic value prop of crypto and try to propose things like rolling back transactions on the bitcoin blockchain. Just absurd. \n\nFrankly, looking at all the exchange token gains over the last bull run makes me sick.  Not just because of the FTX style collapses, but to think of all the gains being directly taken away from good projects in the space and all of us investors, and being given to vaporware and frauds.  Not to mention the fact that once people buy into these tokens they become shills for the fraud.  Never underestimate the blinders that making money will put on you.  \n\nWe have to do a better job of educating ourselves and each other about this type of thing for the space to succeed.\n\n1) Best is to hold your own keys. If you hold the keys then the bankman's don't.\n\n2) This is essentially holding your own keys but I'll remind people DEX's exist and you should use them.\n\n3) Third best is to use an old centralized exchange that's been around since before 2017-18 and is just an exchange. It doesn't have a token and isn't involved with FTX or similar behaviors like trying to be a hedge fund or trading firm or blockchain.\n\nGood luck out there kiddos.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z4fgo4\/never_use_an_exchange_which_has_its_own_token\/","author":"RickandMowgli","num_comments":327,"created_utc":1669388558000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"Never use an exchange which has it's own token.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":32,"selftext":"To clear up any misconceptions early, the founder of Huobi was set to sell 100% of his stake in Huobi. Justin Sun bought what is likely some significant part of the stake if not 100% of it. Officially, he describes himself as an 'global advisor'  yet there are many reports of him making very powerful and sweeping changing at the firm, such as taking control of and overhauling entire departments that are of significance. SBF was also rumoured to be involved in the deal as taking part in discussions and meetings. There were also reports that he set on firing significant amounts of staff that were later 'denied' by Huobi but they still said to be possible. Many of the execs left also when Justin came into his management powers. This is also why HT was included in the list of Sun-owned tokens involved in the FTX credit facility allowing FTX users using Sun-owned tokens to withdraw after FTX fell apart, another hint of deeper ties between SBF and SBF.\n\nNow, Huobi published their asset transparency report which is basically a preliminary publishing to their proof of reserves. As is the case with an alarming number of exchanges, their proof of reserves is only a snapshot, after which funds can be liquidated, shifted or manipulated any way they like if they so choose. Regardless, the reports paints a strange picture.\n\n50% of the funds in Huobi reserves are made up of TRX(\\~15%) and HT(\\~35%) tokens.  This may pose several issues.\n\n1. How much of user funds are actually backed fully and how much is made up of printed TRX and HT tokens?\n2. This high percentage is made up of exchange controlled funds can be indicative of another 'FTT infinite money scheme'. Sun himself admitted he owns 'tens of millions of HT', likely in addition to what is held on Huobi. With an market cap of only around 700 million, he controls a very significant portion of HT such that a scheme like this is very profitable, and feasible, for him. Him mimicking SBF's FTX-Alameda-similar situation is not all that unlikely as I already pointed out the links between SBF and Sun.\n3. Such a high percentage of exchange controlled funds can lead of ease of market manipulation. Especially between the HT controlled by Sun and Huobi itself, Sun effectively can control prices however he likes. We also saw Sun's willingness to do just this as in the FTX credit facility when they blocked deposits of Sun-owned tokens leading to prices rising as high as 4000% above the market price as users desperate to withdraw bought these tokens at any price. Sun(and SBF) also deliberately caused the price spike by limiting token liquidity injection to $13M(supply) when there were about $9B(demand) stuck on FTX. Sun made a killing off of this, as of course **HE** could withdraw his profits but other users couldn't.\n4. If user funds *do happened* to be fully backed, why do exchange-controlled tokens represent half of its reserves? At worst, this bodes of manipulation\/fraud and even at best it represents a HUGE single point of failure for Huobi. A fall in price in either token could have disastrous consequences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional to point 1, I can see Sun using customer funds to buy his own tokens to pump his own bags of the many HT and TRX tokens he owns,  such that they may have the capital value of the backing but not actually hold the 'physical' coin reserves. But of course, this is just *speculation* *right.*\n\nHuobi also abandoned their own stablecoin HUSD(issued by Stable Universal) early this year. More recently, they delisted the token and it depegged all the way to $0.15. This is planned to be replaced by Sun's USDD. Sun's DAO Tron in February named SBF's Alameda Research a whitelisted institution permitting Alameda the rights to mint and the right to burn  USDD as well as act as advisor and recommender to the network. Just another of the Sun-SBF ties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTldr: Clearly, (as pointed out in point 4), this is a terrible sign. Justin Sun does not have a great track record so in the worst case this cause mean some deep manipulation\/fraud. Even in the best case giving the greatest benefit of the doubt it is still terrible to have such a heavy reliance and dependence on the two tokens alone. This situation doesn't look good at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-10-14\/crypto-s-justin-sun-says-he-owns-tens-of-millions-huobi-tokens](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-10-14\/crypto-s-justin-sun-says-he-owns-tens-of-millions-huobi-tokens)\n\n[https:\/\/wublock.substack.com\/p\/exclusive-the-real-buyer-of-huobi](https:\/\/wublock.substack.com\/p\/exclusive-the-real-buyer-of-huobi)\n\n[https:\/\/blockworks.co\/huobi-stablecoin-plunges-70-as-justin-sun-readies-tron-replacement\/](https:\/\/blockworks.co\/huobi-stablecoin-plunges-70-as-justin-sun-readies-tron-replacement\/)\n\n[https:\/\/blockworks.co\/news\/crypto-moguls-compete-for-huobi-majority-stake-report](https:\/\/blockworks.co\/news\/crypto-moguls-compete-for-huobi-majority-stake-report)\n\n[https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/huobi-global-denies-large-scale-layoffs-and-key-exec-resignations](https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/huobi-global-denies-large-scale-layoffs-and-key-exec-resignations)","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z4fpou\/serious_50_of_justin_suns_huobi_reserves_are_made\/","author":"OneThatNoseOne","num_comments":38,"created_utc":1669389190000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANALYSIS","title":"[SERIOUS] 50% of Justin Sun's Huobi Reserves Are Made Up of HT and TRX Tokens That Are Centrally Controlled By Sun and Huobi","distinguished":null,"id":"z4fpou","downs":null,"ups":null}

I will say up front that most of what I will say is highly speculative and lacking any substantial evidence, but Barbara Fried seems to reek of involvement in my opinion.\n\nBarbara Fried is a professor of Law at Stanford University and former attorney specializing in litigation and corporate law. The average salary of a Stanford professor seems to be 180k-250k a year. Barbara Fried has written about topics such as Utilititarianism, and Effective Altruism, both alleged \"interests\" of SBF which she claims to have \"noticed\" in Sam from a young age.\n\nWhat I find most peculiar is that Barbara Fried is a co-founder, and until the aftermath of the recent FTX collapse, she was a key player in a political fundraising organization known as \"Mind the Gap\"\n\nMind the Gap is a relatively young silicon valley based donor firm formed in 2018 that raises funds specifically for Democratic Party candidates in the US in a very closed door and secretive fashion. Mind the Gap was described in 2020 by vox media as \"Silicon Valleys secretive donor group\".. despite it being relatively immature and strangely successful in its short lifetime:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.vox.com\/platform\/amp\/recode\/2020\/1\/6\/21046631\/mind-the-gap-silicon-valley-democratic-donors-stanford\n\nSams brother Gabe was also a member of the board holding an undisclosed position, until the aftermath of the FTX collapse, when both Gabe and Barbara Fried have both stepped down front MTG since the fallout:\n\nhttps:\/\/dailycaller.com\/2022\/11\/16\/sbf-mom-resigns-dem-dark-money\/\n\nFurthermore, the MTG website seems to have been taken down since the fallout:\n\nhttps:\/\/mtg.org\/\n\nNeither Barbara Fried or the MTG organization have been responsive to inquiries from press.\n\nWhat's odd is that nobody leading this group seems to have any political fundraising experience, and it is comprised of almost exclusively Stanford Academics. The firm has also popped up within the past 4 years seemingly out of thin air. The group formed their network and starting receiving political donations preceding the 2018 election.\n\nSBF as we all know happens to have been one of the largest benefactors the democratic party candidates, as we all know by now.. it seems odd to me that a group like Mind the Gap, led by professors of Law would be able to make such waves in political fundraising from Silicon Valley tech firms in such a short time span. This is where I assume there is some kind of connection.. \n\nMaybe I'm crazy, but is it possible SBF could have funneled capital through his own mother's political donor platform both enriching his parents and gaining political influence in the process?\n\nI'm just spitballing here, but it seems incredibly coincidental that this firm, which clearly had an impact on the outcome of the previous election is not in some way connected to the FTX scandal. It seems strange to me that there hasn't really been any press released on this peculiar connection..\n\nI think Barbara Fried and Mind the Gap need to be thoroughly investigated for involvement in FTXs wrong doings and corruption, because the conflict of interests seems pretty unbelievably uncanny.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z4gf8c\/sbfs_mother_reeks_of_involvement_in_ftxs\/","author":"DeeperBags","num_comments":83,"created_utc":1669390976000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"SBFs mother reeks of involvement in FTXs wrongdoings","distinguished":null,"id":"z4gf8c","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":2,"selftext":"In the wake of the FTX crisis and overall fear in the market there's been a revival of a discussion that was largely ignored and even dismissed during this last bull cycle: decentralization.\n\nNow more than ever the crypto community needs to rally behind protocols that focus on being fully decentralized and built with the true Ethereum ethos in mind. Think AAVE, Curve, Uniswap and Optimism. All of these protocols function through bull and bear adhering to the law of code.\n\nAs we put more stock into this ethos that many of forgotten we can begin to heal as a community. We can get developers interested. We can build a better image for crypto that has been tarnished by the recent actions of a few bad actors that only used this tech for purposes of greed and personal gain.\n\nIn order to usher in this new era of dapp development we need a way to decentralize and streamline the coding process to creating these dapps. This is where EthereansOS comes in to play.\n\nWhat is EthereansOS?\n\nIT's a code marketplace: The factory model lets developers write\/share battle tested contract code and monetize it for other developers to use. Get payed for writing quality code that you think other devs will need. This also creates a development standard for creating dapps and adds an added layer of peer review and security to prevent malicious contract code\n\nIt's a NFT marketplace: The ITEMS protocol built by EthereansOS allows you to itemize your NFT or ERC-20 into an ITEM. An ITEM is a hybrid token standard of ERC-20\/1155\/721. Creating an ITEM allows you to place NFTs into DeFi protocols (think farming, lending, etc). You can also wrap any of the three individual token standards into an ITEM. You can also trade them using the interface.\n\nDAO creation tools: Using EthereansOS you can create an organisation with many custom parameters. Voting happens securely on-chain\n\nDeFI tool suite: You can use Covenants ( the DeFi toolset) to bootstrap liquidity for your projects using an easy to customize farming contract\/interface\n\nYou can use this on Optimism L2 as well. Colonies is a new protocol under the EthereansOS umbrella that allows organisations to post fees from L1 to L2 automatically to minimize gas costs for users.\n\nCurrently close to their full release. Feel free to join the discord if you're a dev or if you share the same interest in creating a better name for crypto \n\nYou can read more about it here: [https:\/\/docs.ethos.wiki\/ethereansos-docs\/](https:\/\/docs.ethos.wiki\/ethereansos-docs\/)","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z4t9q8\/ethereansos_why_decentralization_matters\/","author":"FriendlyTemperature","num_comments":1,"created_utc":1669423182000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"TOOLS","title":"EthereansOS - Why Decentralization Matters","distinguished":null,"id":"z4t9q8","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":153,"selftext":"I love staying up to date on what happens in the world and in the crypto space, so I read a lot of news and browse \/new here regularly. I have started to get annoyed with the quality of the news posts that cover crypto, however. For instance, a lot of crypto news seems rather inaccurate, seems to lack substance, and\/or seems unnecessarily sensationalist. \n\nIf you agree, why is this? Is this just a general news problem or are these quality issues more severe in this space? I'll give a few examples from just this week below to illustrate what I mean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\n**Example 1: How mainstream (corporate) media dealt with the FTX Meltdown**\n\nThe most crazy example is how mainstream media dealt with the FTX meltdown. Rather than covering FTX's fraud and how they scammed millions of users, the media chose to focus on Sam Bankman-Fried's plans to save the world, even though Sam already admitted his woke behavior was just a front to appear likeable.\n\n[Investing.com](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jx0skjisma2a1.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbd0be18ebf8ebb7d431810ea870943211cbd27e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Wall Street Journal](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/l0osspp3na2a1.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e354293607e638723eead09287d52090ef4a065)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Example 2: Sensational headlines**\n\nA lot of the articles use insane sensationalist headlines. For instance, a recent Forbes post linked Binance's recovery fund to Terra Luna in the title but never addressed why they mentioned Terra Luna, likely because there was no reason other than to have a sensationalist headline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zothdur4oa2a1.png?width=568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9a340db4a3434bffcc3dc23f9ed14dd44396c10\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Example 3: A lack of substance**\n\nA lot of news posts are not *really* news posts because they lack substance. A prime example are all these news posts about Charles Hoskinson because he wrote a sentence on Twitter somewhere. These often use words like \"slam\" or \"destroy\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/r2oqg6j5ta2a1.png?width=849&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2854888a7918a6c61dc30ff5cde7ee36f00cb380\n\nA contentless article based on a single sentence on Twitter:\n\n[Twitter](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5u10yvidta2a1.png?width=557&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bedb04e11f67bdb93ca63d09948e3323ca38cdb8)\n\nThe same articles get written whenever Elon Musk makes a Twitter post, such as the one below because Elon wrote a single sentence on Twitter (\"WSJ giving foot massages to a criminal\").\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Finbold](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3p284adfua2a1.png?width=832&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b09cd6fdb5b86406758d7c9b72c33e146094b0b)","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z57wth\/is_it_me_or_is_a_lot_of_crypto_news_of_poor\/","author":"Beyonderr","num_comments":97,"created_utc":1669470319000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"Is it me or is a lot of crypto news of poor quality (lack of substance, unnecessarily sensationalist, inaccurate)?

We got a small break during the FTX collapse but they are back up in number. We may get some kind of analysis, at times good tho that is rare, most of the time half-baked and other times completely nonsensical. Even at this point in time people are looking for prices pump when crypto is going through what is likely the most chaotic, uncertainly and trustless moments in cryptos history. It shows you were at least some if not a lot of people here are for. We are at a point when things could *potentially* all collapse but these people are still chasing the pump. Although I would personally say a fully collapse is more unlikely, the point still stands.\n\nEven then, if those people actually thought about things they'd realise that there is no way prices can pump. Apart from the terrible state of the general macroeconomy, crypto is going through serious 'growing pains'(to put it nicely) of its own. Even if all you care about is the pump, crypto has to fix its issues to have any chance to properly become an asset of it's own and break from stock correlations.\n\nCEXes and their reserves need to become trustless and blockchain validated by math so we don't need to rely on founders' 'trust me bro'. Defi needs to become more hack-resistant to encourage self-custody and those who prefer complete anonymity. Regulation is coming whether we like it or not but we need regulation and not overregulation where government doesn't go overboard and stifle crypto. We probably still need crypto to be simplified for the regular Joe for mass adoption. It is only when this is fixed when crypto can pump as more average people enter the sector since they can easily use it and they can trust it.\n\nIt doesn't really matter if you're here for the tech or just here for the gains.  Pumps full of hot air only quickly deflate and go nowhere. We need pumps backed by tech and value for prices 'to moon'.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":2,"selftext":"To be fair, almost every rational actor in the crypto investment space should know by now that exchanges are bad, period. Unless the binary 1s and 0s are actually in your possession (in a crypto wallet), it's all technically \"vaporware money\" which can evaporate any time just like FTX tokens and FTX company itself.\n\nAnd still, we see lot's of people flocking towards exchanges like FTX and parking their hard earned money there. I don't want to think that they're all irrational actors, though a handful of them may be. TBH the first crypto exchange to go down was [Mt Gox](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mt._Gox) in 2014, followed by several others since. To me, it's a very rational thing to stay away from exchanges entirely but perhaps for a risk loving investor it may not?\n\nI think, we can categorize people who invest in crypto exchanges into following categories:\n\n1. **Investors with high risk appetite.** Simply holding BTC in your wallet is enough to have its value appreciate against USD but some people want their BTC to increase with compound interest just like a bank fixed deposit. They have higher risk appetite for a higher return and exchanges like FTX provide them an outlet.\n2. **Youngsters who bought into the anti-capitalism narrative.** There are many youngsters today who hate the world's capitalist system in general and conflate that system with the global financial system too. As a result, they won't touch mainstream financial instruments (like a Bank FD) but choose crypto exchanges instead.\n3. **Gullible people who bought into the FUD.** There are many who just fall for the narrative and propaganda (a friend who spouts wisdom, etc.) without even thinking whether they have appetite for high risk or not.\n\nI'd also like to think there is a fourth \"hidden\" category of what I'd call \"State and non-state actors laundering money for politicians\". Isn't it a fact that SBF donated $75 billion to democrats and also about $25 billion to republicans? There is a great possibility that those donations may not have been *effective altruism* as claimed but actually being pushed by these fourth category of investors!\n\nBut there are many innocent people across the world who lost their real and hard earned wealth to SBF in this exchange meltdown. The [Tamil Actress Aathmika](https:\/\/twitter.com\/im_aathmika\/status\/1591321637559087112) seems to be one, for example.\n\nI don't think there is any way to stop these gullible people from investing in crypto exchanges but could there be a way to make this space a bit more safer? The obvious solution to centralization is decentralization, but how do you do that with exchanges? A common sense solution could be to have more exchanges. Why have only a handful like FTX, Binance and Coinbase? Why not have lot's of them and advise people to not put all eggs in one basket?\n\nEven regulation is not bad if it comes from a place of good heart and intention. Do you think regulation of crypto exchanges with rules like they have for NASDAQ and Dow Jones could have prevented this? Even though people are saying FTX\/SBF was bad for crypto, I think there is a great opportunity for reflection and progress here.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z5y0ur\/the_post_ftx_world_same_old_exchange\/","author":"learned_cheetah","num_comments":18,"created_utc":1669545292000,"edited":1669547531000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"The Post FTX world, same old exchange centralization problem and where we go from here: A few thoughts","distinguished":null,"id":"z5y0ur","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":0,"selftext":" \n\nHi, first post here!\n\nI'd like to share my views on Coinbase stock, as at this moment there are some key factors I consider relevant taking into consideration, which are:\n\n1. Obvious one: crypto markets are in a bear stage, and have historically behaved as cyclical markets, so odds are quite storng on a bull market during 2023 \/ 2024. Ofc, this doesn't mean that it will recover its 60k + all time max, but I believe it is quite reasonable to see a growth in btc market cap and price.\n2. BTC, the biggest crypto in the market, will be halved probably during 1st half of 2023. Maybe my analysis is quite simplistic, but I would bet that is a factor to consider. On its own maybe its not to make BTC rise.\n3. Markets expect a FED pivot in interest rates, maybe in 50 basis points. There is a strong consensus that high interest rates are translated into stock and crypto price decrease. A FED pivot would also be a factor that could make BTC rise.\n4. If BTC rises, and so its market cap, it will probably mean the crypto market will also follow that tendency. That would extremely benefit COIN balance sheet and cashflow.\n5. FTX, on of the biggest competitors, is down. The scandal around it is now scaring away people from crypto markets even more, making everything that has \"crypto\" on its name toxic to investors. Prices, as a natural consequence, are going down. COIN rumors over FTX crash contagion have been dissipated as the company stated it only had 15$ million of deposits with FTX.\n6. Given the probable chance that crypto markets could experience a bull phase during the next year, the two main options new traders will have are BNB (biggest and most popular one, lower fees) and COIN (which is more welcoming to new investors). The focus COIN has over attracting new investors with a simple, intuitiv eapp, could be a good advantage towards its main competitor in a stage when market is receiving loads of newcomers. Plus, COIN doesn't seem to have as many legal\/regulatory problems as Binance does.\n7. COIN profits as a result of its share in USDC, which went up more than a 360% since last year, and will probably continue to grow (can't tell if in the same proportion, but USDC is currently one of the leading ones in the e money market).\n8. COIN has 5,006,584 $ only in cash. It's 50% share on Centre Consortium (USDC) hasn't provided an exact data about its financials, but it could aslo have a big amount of it. Compared to its current 10,000,000 market cap, knowing for sure they have 5,000,0000 in cash and God knows what from USDC, that by itself seems a good reason to invest in COIN.\n\nSo, this is my first post ever here, first time making a stock analysis, if you can say that what I've done is one. I'd like to hear your thoughts about it!\n\nAnd please, forgive my english in case I made any spelling mistakes, I'm from Barcelona.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z5zq7t\/coinbase_stock\/","author":"Titanat","num_comments":36,"created_utc":1669551069000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ADVICE","title":"Coinbase stock","distinguished":null,"id":"z5zq7t","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":0,"selftext":"Based on a quick search [Blender.io](https:\/\/Blender.io) received the \"first ever\" sanctions against a cryptocurrency mixer in May, 2022. With the FTX collapse, there have been questions about wBTC and others.  \n\n\nI have the following legal question(s) for qualified competent lawyers to answer, please and thank you (please state the jurisdiction on which your analysis is based):  \n\n\nIf you consider the typical implementation of ERC20 (or indeed, many other kinds of wrappers also not based on the EVM), and many bridges, they are in fact internally implemented like a mixer, relative to their reserves. Here's what I mean. In what follows, replace wBTC with any wrapped token contract, I'm just using wBTC to avoid ambiguity in the discussion.  \n\n\nIf two users create a total of 10 wBTC, the wBTC contract is holding 10 BTC. The word \"holding\" here amounts to a single variable in the code that tracks the amount of BTC held in (for simplicity's sake) a single BTC address associated with the wBTC contract. When you mint wBTC that variable increases and the wBTC contract then tracks your balance of wBTC using a map of ether wallet addresses to wBTC quantity (i.e., your wallet address is credited with some # of wBTC). However, you don't own a specific tranche of the underlying BTC, you just own a certain amount of that BTC pile.  \n\n\nWhen you transfer wBTC the wBTC contract is changing the amount of wBTC associated with your address and the receiver's address. The underlying BTC does not move. In some sense, that underlying BTC is \"the same BTC\" that got put in initially, no matter how many wBTC transfers have occurred.  \n\n\nNow, when someone burns wBTC (to recover the BTC), the contract reduces its BTC balance on the basis of the underlying BTC transfer. The receiver of the BTC may or may not be the minter of that particular tranche of BTC if we were to consider the minted BTC as a set of tranches hypothecated (minted) in FIFO order and returned (burned) in FIFO order.  \n\n\nI don't want to focus on the mixer analogy too much. I'm more focused on the notion that the pile of BTC entered into an wrapper contract is in fact static relative to wBTC transactions, and really only ever \"moves\" during mint\/burn transactions.  \n\n\nOk, now say you have a wrapper contract like wBTC where 95% of it's reserves has come from a single entity, and the proceeds hypothecated in the wBTC contract by that entity are ill-gotten, fraudulent, or at least, have civil claims. Then, some number of mint\/burn transactions may occur, the total value of which may be more, or less, than that initial deposit -- but lets say all of those follow on mint\/burns have a net zero effect on the total balance held in wBTC. I.e., the TVL has remained flat or increased.  \n\n\n(1) Can you give us some quick background on what either bankruptcy, other tort law, and criminal law says about how claims on an asset may or may not result in claims on follow on assets acquired with the asset on which the claims exist? I.e., are such claims on the asset or only against the entity holding that asset? E.g., in a cash situation if I hand someone $1k for safe keeping and that person purchases 1 apple from 1000 random grocery stores, and the apples go bad, I imagine I have no recourse vs the grocery stores. Does that depend on whether the store owners knowingly accepted fraudulent assets, or does there exist a hard bar against clawbacks beyond the first fraudulent conveyance? etc etc  \n\n\n(2) Unlike cash, cryptocurrencies leave a paper trail, some of which may be obscured by the operation of system components such as wBTC wrappers and\/or more explicit mixers. Ultimately, however, there might exist a situation where arguably, the vast majority of the reserves of a contract like wBTC are of known provenance. For example, one observation we can make is that in the absence of mint\/burn transactions of at least equal value to the 95% mints from the fraudulent conveyance, the input assets are located. In the presence of mint\/burn transactions that total more than the initial deposit, we might observe that if all of those follow on transactions are \"small,\" then one could argue that the fraudulent conveyance is located up to the wBTC balance minus the largest such follow on transfer.  \n\n\nOf course, if the original fraudulent minter of wBTC still holds the wBTC, claimants may be entitled to that wBTC as a matter of the \"liquidated\" value of the fraudster. However, if that fraudster bought bad apples, what can we say about the pile of BTC in the wBTC contract, which is arguably still located? Can the wBTC contract itself be characterized as a \"lender\" such that a claw back may occur, etc etc.  \n\n\nPlease forgive my lay use of potentially precisely defined legal terms. Hopefully I've made the topic I'm exploring clear. I look forward to reading responses from competent readers. Thanks in advance.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z68x7n\/wrapped_tokens_bridges_as_mixers_andor_location\/","author":"SecretPressure9813","num_comments":13,"created_utc":1669574521000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"REGULATIONS","title":"Wrapped tokens &amp; bridges as mixers and\/or location of underlying?

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":8,"selftext":"Thanks to the recommendation of many YouTubers. Many people have lost their money on the failed cryptocurrency exchange, FTX. The most troublesome stories are from those who have claimed to have invested their life savings on the platform. \n\nAs terrible as it is to make this statement. You ultimately deserve this.\n\nDon't get me wrong. This isn't to be spiteful to those who have made a speculative bet. Well, not entirely. They would also deserve to make money from their speculative bet as well. What I am trying to get people to appreciate is that both the positive and negative outcomes end being the responsibility of the investor.\n\nYou just know that if these investors did make a win how much they would attribute it to their own merits. How only they were capable of achieving a feat so great. How you can do it too with enough hard work and determination. If they were winners, they would be pretentious and toxic about their gains.\n\nAs their bet didn't go their own way, they're the victims. The victims of a scam promoted by YouTubers. The \"system\" scammed them. But it wasn't a scam a fortnight ago when they were still milking it. It was only a scam when it didn't work out for them specifically. \n\nIf you chose to go all in, that is on you. You don't deserve a bailout. This is part of being your own bank. You're going to make investments, as a bank, that won't work out. You will also make some investments that will work out. \n\nIf investors can't manage their money properly on cryptocurrency. What chance does this have in the mainstream? You have to remember that these people are also likely to make egregious claims about how terrible the poor are with their own money. \n\nYou took the bet. You thought you could do better than 8% risk-free bonds. You thought 8% was a pittance, now you have nothing. That 8% doesn't seem so bad now, does it?

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":6,"selftext":"There is no amount of line drawing on charts and patterns or whatever that is ever going to tell you what is going to cause the market to move at the end of the day, crypto trades like every other risky asset like the SNP500. It is still affected by macroeconomics and it matters a lot, obviously crypto native stuff matters too whether that is things like the FTX debacle or the Luna collapse, there are a lot of fundamental factors you need to take into account. There are no candlestick patterns that are going to tell you whether or not these things are going to happen now. \n\nHere is an in-depth literature review from 2004 \u201cThe Profitability of Technical Analysis: A Review\u201d (https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=603481) by Cheol-Ho Park and Scott H. Irwin, which concludes that technical analysis does not work. In fact, it only concluded that it worked up until the early 90s after which it was mostly priced in, which is why it does not work anymore. And here is a slightly more updated version of this from the CFA \u2013 \u201cTechnical Analysis: Modern Perspectives\u201d (https:\/\/www.cfainstitute.org\/en\/research\/foundation\/2017\/technical-analysis) by Gordon Scott, Michael Carr and Mark Cremonie, again this is an in-depth literature review on technical analysis which has summed up all the other different papers on the subject and this has found the same exact result as that previous paper. And there is another paper \u201cLikely Gains from Market Timing\u201d (https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/4477805) which explains why technical analysis looks like it works and there is a reason why it looks like it works, it is because of something called timing luck. This paper explains it quite well. \n\nTechnical analysis does not work in and of itself because you need to have a fundamental thesis as to why you want to be in a certain coin, token, or crypto asset, whatever it may be and then the technical analysis may make you feel a bit better about yourself when you go and make that decision, but at the end of the day people typically look at a lot of different quant models and a variety of different fundamental models and indicators and then come up with the overall investment thesis, they debate these things in depth and then eventually put on that trade and then at that last step you might be inclined to look at technical analysis to make yourself feel better.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z6rqex\/technical_analysis_and_crypto\/","author":"SageKnows","num_comments":33,"created_utc":1669626406000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"Technical Analysis and Crypto","distinguished":null,"id":"z6rqex","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":44,"selftext":"News media(as usual) as well as people in the community have been freaking out, questioning if this is the time when crypto will fall into a deep dark winter. People are thinking that the fall of the second largest crypto platform will pull the rug out from under the entire industry. This is not so. This is actually the moment that saved us from a Lehman Crisis.\n\nThe Lehman Crisis and 2008 GFC was caused by \n\n1. blind faith in financial institutions that borrowers were properly audited to ensure they are fully capable of repayments\n2. regulators incapable of proper oversight to prevent points-of-failure\n3. banks *so* greedy as to sacrifice their entire organizations future over some short-term profits\n4. deposited funds are held securely and are fully backed by banks.\n\nCrypto and time fix the first three points. Crypto by itself usually has over-collaterlized loans such that you may only borrow less than the collateral you issue so as to mitigate any failure to repay. This is as long as you aren't borrowing any illiquid or 'brown' coins with which to manipulate markets and profit a la Moolah Finance and Mango  markets. We then have Defi that allow you to take full control of your funds. This collapse has taught us not to blindly trust any institutions, whether they be a bank or those who proclaim to save us from banks. And then regulation is coming whether we like it or not, and I imagine quite a few of us would have changed our opinion on it with recent events.\n\nDefi pretty much solves all these issues for the most part, however some may still want to stick to Cefi, due to lack of ability or education to manage and secure our own funds as well as lower fees and simple convenience. Even for Cefi, things are getting better. [Binance](https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/binance-proof-of-reserve-pledge-gains-support-following-ftx-crisis) and [Crypto.com](https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/crypto-com-commits-to-proof-of-reserves-after-halting-certain-deposits-and-withdrawals) have committed to proof-of-reserves audits. The people at Kraken [already provide proof of reserves](https:\/\/www.kraken.com\/proof-of-reserves), which should show you that, while they may not be infallible or perfect, should show you where their priorities lie. Bitmex as of yesterday [provided a snapshot](https:\/\/blog.bitmex.com\/bitmex-provides-snapshot-update-to-proof-of-reserves-proof-of-liabilities\/) of theirs. OKX and Kucoin [say their proof-of-reserves](https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/okx-kucoin-say-proof-of-reserves-will-be-ready-in-a-month) will be ready in a month. This list [also includes](https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2022\/11\/09\/crypto-exchanges-scramble-to-compile-proof-of-reserves-as-ftx-contagion-grips-markets\/) Gate.io, Poloniex, Bitget, Huobi, Deribit and Bybit who have all made separate statements to provided merkle tree-based(a tree like data structure in computer science) proof-of-reserves. We are also pushing toward live PoR rather than snapshot-based ones.  These are meant to show and give full transparency that all tokens\/coins deposited on the platform are fully backed funds that are present and held by the platform. This solves the last problem I outlined. This collapse has just made things simpler. Don't invest in any exchange that does not provide audit proof-of-reserves. Admittedly, proof of liabilities is also needed for full trust but Gate io, Kraken and Coinbase have already published these that puts pressure on the rest of the industry to step up.\n\nSo one day, Kraken was alone in providing this and now we have **11** of the largest exchanges following suit *thus far*. If this is not an **entire** industry shift for the better,  I don't  know what is. The fall right now may be hard, but it is saving us from bigger falls in the future.\n\nNow granted, this does not solve the problem of price volatility, which would be sorted out as more people get into crypto with its growing acceptance. The prices then will no longer jump by large fractions of a percentage as there will be more people buying in-between those prices that stabilize it. We will also be more sure of its fair value as crypto is actually implemented into its use cases. But this is not crypto's Lehman moment, this is the moment that saves us from reaching that point.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z6ufae\/this_is_not_cryptos_2008_lehman_crisis_moment_its\/","author":"OneThatNoseOne","num_comments":35,"created_utc":1669635891000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"This Is Not Crypto's 2008 Lehman Crisis Moment.

While some may have hoped that a whole government would give a responsible explanation to all this were proven wrong.\n\nThe call basically started them going over the story of what happened one by one. According to them a bank run was sparked on FTX by Binance and the Coindesk article. Then on the 10th Nov the government froze FTX assets. They applaud themselves a lot for acting so swiftly on that (even though it was still late).\n\nAnd then there is basically nothing else than self-promotion for the Bahamas. Also they criticized the new FTX CEO John Ray saying that he was talking bad for the \u201camazing actions\u201c done by the Bahamas government, even saying that he talked so due to him going after the money.\n\nThey literally took NO responsibility for the FTX collapse nor how they basically misused the assets of customers.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":594,"selftext":"Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX execs donated a total of $70 million to political campaigns toward the mid-term election cycle. This sum made FTX the third-largest donor across the entire political landscape for this mid-term election cycle. The individuals who donated included Bankman-Fried himself, co-CEO Ryan Salame and Director of Engineering Nishad Singh. They donated a rough 55%\/45% split between both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nFTX US also donated an additional $1M as well a super-PAC vying for Senate control on October 27th, filing for bankruptcy only weeks later. This is where at least some of customer funds went. Meanwhile, FTX was running at a huge losses.\n\nAs a result, eight House members wrote a letter and made statements that seriously questioned the legitimacy in many ways of the SEC's inquiry into crypto companies going as far as to say it may violate law. It was revealed at least five of the eight members received campaign donations from FTX  employees, ranging from $2,900 to $11,600. Rep. Ted Budd (R-NC), one of  the signatories, received half a million dollars in support from a Super PAC created by FTX co-CEO Ryan Salame. And Congressman Emmer's organization, is particular received $2.75 million from FTX in the 2022 cycle; $2 million from FTX's Salame in late September, and $750,000 from the company\u2019s political action committee.\n\nSome politicians are now attempting to return the funds from FTX by donating to charities. However, this has only thus far been to politicians who return a paltry sum amounting to less than $10,000.\n\nNow, SBF donated to the GMI PAC as well as $23M to the Protect Our Future PAC. All 19 of the congressional candidates backed by GMI PAC won their races last week, sending 16 new members to the House and Senate. We will see where this takes us.\n\nSources:\n\n[Yahoo](https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-210458468.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKrPN3jnoePC97mBEnChUrueIjGEjunupCplVBYRSQHB-GK6j5ZasPWuzTjtgct5uuyl47CzSPi8ovTO0oLQ1dAXDCu3CINi8UUCCGRU1tDATxWFpC_4msZKT_Dovyy81hkg_SUt2clGdJAsCjfiOQrSz1zPWMyyrrWVcOl0Mm4a)\n\n[Bloomberg](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-11-25\/ftx-mcconnell-bankman-fried-super-pac-donation)\n\n[Prospect](https:\/\/prospect.org\/power\/congressmembers-tried-to-stop-secs-inquiry-into-ftx\/)\n\n[Politco](https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2022\/11\/15\/lawmakers-return-ftx-money-00067009)\n\n[Coindesk](https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/policy\/2022\/11\/15\/cryptos-political-cash-backs-winners-but-new-lawmakers-will-arrive-under-ftx-cloud\/)\n\n[OpenSecrets](https:\/\/www.opensecrets.org\/outside-spending\/detail\/2022?cmte=C00801514&amp;tab=targeted_candidates)","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z73c8x\/seriousftx_and_execs_donated_over_70_million_to\/","author":"OneThatNoseOne","num_comments":171,"created_utc":1669658362000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"ANALYSIS","title":"[SERIOUS]FTX and Execs donated over $70 Million to the election, some just 2 weeks before bankruptcy.

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":8,"selftext":"The below is partially taken from the Blockworks Daily email.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt may feel like everything in crypto that could go wrong, has gone wrong.\u00a0\n\nBut crypto Twitter is now more than ever a constant drumbeat of which domino is next to fall.\u00a0\n\nWe may have previously dismissed all of these theories without much thought, but the lesson of FTX may be that nothing is to be dismissed. Ever.\u00a0\n\nSo what tin-hat theories should we be paying attention to? Here are a few of the leading candidates, alongside arguments for and against.\n\n**Grayscale Bitcoin Trust**\n\nTheory: Grayscale doesn't hold the bitcoin it claims to hold.\n\nFor: This would explain the huge and expanding discount to NAV that GBTC trades at.\n\nAgainst: Grayscale custodies its bitcoin with Coinbase, and Coinbase would probably tell us if they were short. Grayscale is audited \u2014 and not by an auditor that claims to live in the metaverse (like FTX\u2019s). Grayscale is regulated by the SEC. They are owned by a good (if currently impaired) actor \u2014 Barry Silbert\u2019s DCG. And on-chain sleuths say they do, in fact, hold the bitcoin they claim to.\n\nRisk level: 1\/10. After realizing all the bitcoin being traded at FTX was fictional, it seems more imaginable that Grayscale could be selling fictional bitcoin, too. But I still find it pretty unimaginable.\n\n**Tether** \n\nTheory: Tether doesn\u2019t hold all the reserves it claims to hold.\n\nFor: We\u2019ve been waiting on a full audit of Tether's reserves for years. Tether is offshore and unregulated. It\u2019s not always been clear where offshore.\u00a0\n\nAgainst: Lindyness: If Tether was going to fail, it surely would have by now, right? Tether has been processing billions of redemptions without issue. \u201cAssurance opinions\u201d have offered more transparency.\n\nRisk level: 5\/10: An \"assurance opinion\" is not an audit. Tether says that 9% of its assets are in secured loans, with \"none to affiliated entities.\" But if SBF couldn't resist taking a $1 billion loan from Alameda, could Tether\u2019s owners resist similarly \"borrowing\" a few billion from the USDT piggy bank?\n\n**Other fiat stablecoins**\n\nTheory: The bank deposits backing fiat stablecoins are at risk.\n\nFor: As detailed here by the ever-vigilant exposer of financial fraud, Edwin Dorsey, stablecoin issuers hold much of their reserves with weirdly small banks. Many of those, like Silvergate Bank, are suspected by Dorsey and others of having, um, less-than-stellar risk and compliance practices.\n\nAgainst: Most stablecoin reserves are invested in Treasurys, which are presumably ring-fenced should the banks that hold them go bust.\u00a0\n\nRisk level: 5\/10. FTX is a reminder that banks can fail and the reserves backing stablecoins are held at banks. Many of those banks are small and some are of questionable character. The crypto exchange FalconX, for example, was concerned enough about Silvergate to stop using it for wires, temporarily.\u00a0\n\nThe concern is understandable: Silvergate\u2019s small depositors are explicitly guaranteed by FDIC, but *all* depositors of, say, JPMorgan, are implicitly guaranteed by the government. Until crypto customers are welcome at too-big-to-fail banks like JPMorgan, stablecoin reserves will be at risk.\n\n**Coinbase**\n\nTheory: Coinbase is doing FTX things \u2014 we just don\u2019t know it yet.\n\nFor: CEO Brian Armstrong\u2019s statement in May that Coinbase has \u201cno risk of bankruptcy\u201d was quickly walked back by the CFO who said on CNBC that Coinbase has a \u201csmall risk of bankruptcy.\u201d Coinbase bonds yield 15%, which suggests the market thinks \u201csmall\u201d might be a little too generous still.\n\nAgainst: Coinbase is US-domiciled and US-regulated. More importantly, it does not offer the type of leveraged products that got FTX in such a mess.\n\nRisk: 0.5\/10. There doesn\u2019t seem to be much to this one other than Brian Armstrong saying things are fine, and whenever a CEO says things are fine, everyone on Twitter assumes they\u2019re not fine.\u00a0\n\n**Binance**\n\nTheory: Binance is doing FTX things, we just don\u2019t know it yet.\n\nFor: Binance has no fixed headquarters and its CEO founder, Changpeng \u2018CZ\u2019 Zhao, lives in anything-goes Dubai, which is less than reassuring. The exchange is mostly off-limits for US customers, the US may be off-limits for CZ (given investigations by the DOJ and IRS), and Binance may have recently helped Iran avoid US sanctions.\n\nAgainst: Binance\u2019s BNB Coin has a $47 billion market cap. There\u2019s no on-chain evidence that Binance is in any sort of distress (\u201cweird vibes\u201d is the worst the Twitter sleuths can do). Binance is probably crypto\u2019s most profitable business \u2014 and probably by a wide margin.\n\nRisk level: 3\/10. I\u2019m not going to brush everyone with the SBF brush \u2014 SBF is not a normal person. Most people are normal. CZ seems pretty normal.\n\n**Hoping for the best**\n\nIn TradFi, it's a red flag when bank executives start giving nuanced answers to yes-or-no questions.\n\nIn crypto, we\u2019ve taken that a large step further: *Any* answer to every question is now a red flag.\n\nAfter SBF tweeted \u201cWe don't invest client assets (even in treasuries)\u201d just days before we found out that FTX had \u201cinvested\u201d nearly *all* client assets in things much, much worse than treasuries, it\u2019s hard to take anyone\u2019s word for anything.\n\nWhich is why we all believe in trustless, decentralized finance.\n\nBut DeFi cannot exist without CeFi, CeFi is complicated, and complexity breeds conspiracy theories.\u00a0\n\nSo far, many of those theories have proven true.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPartially taken from the Blockworks Daily email.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z7h9e7\/tin_hat_times_in_crypto\/","author":"cannainform2","num_comments":28,"created_utc":1669690404000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"Tin Hat Times in Crypto","distinguished":null,"id":"z7h9e7","downs":null,"ups":null}

First this may look promising, because obviously this might help investors that fall victim to bad actors like FTX in the future. But does anyone remember why we have crypto in the first place?\n\nBanks gamble with money, but they are too big to fail at the same time. Whenever a bank goes bust, a government will bail them out. With tax money. While all their gains are private, their losses are literally paid by the public.\n\nThe idea of BTC was most likely born during the financial crisis of 2008. When Satoshi Nakamoto created the [Genesis block](https:\/\/mempool.space\/de\/block\/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f) of BTC, he embedded a recent news headline to prove the block was not premined very long ago. This message was:\n\n&gt;**The Times 03\/Jan\/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks**\n\nSatoshi choosing this headline was very likely no accident, it was a message to everyone showing why we needed something as Bitcoin.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nFast forward to today. \"Crypto\" companies like FTX were thinking they were the banks of the new world order, being able to play the same games as banks. However in crypto, that doesn't go unnoticed. And when things started to smell fishy, people wanted their coins back. But in crypto, no one will bail you out if things go wrong.\n\nCrypto projects shouldn't take huge amounts of debt and they shouldn't gamble with their customers money. They should be the exact opposite of the traditional financial world. If a crypto company or project goes bankrupt, they deserve it. A bad actor shouldn't be bailed out.\n\nNow one could say that the customers deserve their funds back - but this would also send a totally false message. People need to finally understand they don't own crypto when holding at exchanges, and lending will ALWAYS come with the risk of 100% loss, no matter what the companies claim. Risk management is a thing and you should never invest everything in a single project.\n\nHowever the scary part about this is Binance being the provider of this bailout fund. Binance has a completely broken perception of the term \"decentralized\", CZ is even calling Binance a [decentralized company](https:\/\/decrypt.co\/105376\/where-is-binance-hq-ceo-cz-says-coming-due-time). However in reality Binance is not only the heaviest centralized entity in the entire crypto space, it appears like they stop seeing themselves as an \"exchange\", but more as an upcoming \"crypto government\". It's not enough for them to be the biggest exchange, they also want to make the rules of the this space.\n\nThis development goes completely against the fundamentals and history of crypto, it's a huge disgrace for the entire space. I'm not at all against protecting investors - but this really shouldn't be handled by a company which competes with everyone else the same time.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z7tpb6\/the_bailout_fund_from_binance_is_a_disgrace_for\/","author":"Maxx3141","num_comments":87,"created_utc":1669727525000,"edited":1669729374000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"The bailout fund from Binance is a disgrace for crypto and its history","distinguished":null,"id":"z7tpb6","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":0,"selftext":"**Wall of text incoming.**\n\nWhat I hope to achieve is increased public awareness of what it is people **need** to demand from exchanges in order for FTX-esque rugpulls to be a thing of the past.\nAt the same time I'll propose something of a solution\/requirements needed to be fulfilled to mitigate the issues identified. \n\nAfter the latest centralised exchange debacle the call for exchanges to provide a proof of solvency has become too loud for them to ignore. We haven't seen customer trust fall this low since Mt. Gox fell through.  \nHowever every single one of the \"proof of reserves\" currently implemented by exchanges leave too much to be desired: with the most glaring fault of all being that you must **trust** that the data provided by the exchange to the auditing party is not manipulated. Furthermore the timegap between audits makes it possible for exchanges to, amongst other things, send funds around in a circle to prove \"solvency\" at the time of the audit without actually being solvent. \n\n**If this is the end result of the current outrage it will have solved nothing**, as the current implementations of proof of reserves\/solvency do not prove what they are supposed to prove: that the exchange is solvent. And not just at snapshot moment X and\/or relying on valuation of token Y for solvency but that they have not touched customers funds without permission and that if a customer wishes to, their funds are actually available for withdrawal.\n\nHow do you go about solving this? Vitalik &amp; Cz have publicly announced a collaboration but as that might take an unknown amount of time and the outcome of an exchange creating a mechanism that is supposed to prove it's own trustworthyness is not exactly optimal I think everybody would benefit from a public discussion about possible solutions.  \n\n#**Issue at hand**: \nTo ensure an exchange is solvent you need a client list, holdings per client and a list of the wallets that these funds are being held on. In addition to this you need a full disclosure of exchange liabilities and assets both onchain and offchain.\n\nWhilst this sounds relatively simple there are a few core issues that have to be tackled here:\n\n#**-P1.You want to make sure that the data that is supposed to prove the solvency of the exchange is not potentially manipulated by the exchange before an auditor gets to see it.**\n\n\n\n#**-P2.You want to preserve client privacy whilst reducing time between audits to a minimum.**\n\n\n\n#**-P3.You want to ensure the solvency part does not include \"weird\" things(recent examples are FTT\/FTX, Luna, Celsius).**\n\n\n\n#**P1.**\nI think this is the biggest and most difficult part of a potential solution. Ensuring the data has not been corrupted at the source. \n\nThis also means you cannot just call on an API provided by or in control of the exchange as this means you are relying on this information provided by them to be truthful and trustworthy. Not to mention it could be manipulated to give different outputs depending on the requesting party. If you need to trust the exchange to be providing trustworthy information for your version of proof of reserves to work it is inherently flawed and you might aswell not have it as it doesn't prove what it is supposed to.\n\nThis is why Nexo's implementation for example is terrible and can't be trusted as a real proof of reserves: Armanino(auditor) can give an attestation that the data provided by Nexo's API shows X, that does not mean that the data provided to the API is truthful, nor that it isn't relying on their own printed token being able to be sold for $X to maintain solvency. https:\/\/twitter.com\/rue_du_coin\/status\/1591815867570044931\n\nLikewise Binance's proof of reserves: as it currently stands, realistically it doesn't prove anything. They're published by the one supposedly being audited. Merkle trees are great, but unless they're implemented correctly they're no different than an exchange saying \"just trust us\". https:\/\/twitter.com\/jespow\/status\/1596227031637045248?\n\nSome other quick examples; \n\n\nGemini's trust center: Does not prove anything. They ask the customers to trust them that they have their assets. \n\n\n\nKraken's Proof of solvency: best one so far but still lacking. Amongst other things: the time between audits takes too long so it cannot prevent exchanges playing hot potato with funds. Furthermore there is no way to prove as a customer that the exchange is being untruthful if they decide to lower your balance before it is submitted to an auditor. The audit might show that your balance is lower than what you think it should be but there is no way to prove for you as a client that you did not give permission for a trade to have been executed that might have resulted in this subsequent loss of funds.\n\n\n\nIf merkle trees are required: Armanino, Mazars and KPMG all offer merkle tree proof of reserves. Using not one but multiple auditors increases confidence in the accuracy of the data output from these parties. \n\n\nIdeally you would want to use multiple API's provided by multiple independent auditors and aggregate this data to ensure both the data provided to- aswell as the outcome of the audits themselves match. This ensures an exchange cannot alter the data depending on the requestor of the data, as they have no control over these outputs. To aggregate this data you would make use of a decentralised oracle solution. **This is only part of the solution though.**\n\n\nTo make this work you need a system of checks on these balances provided by the exchange to the auditors. A distinction must be made publically between assets of the exchange and assets of clients of the exchange that the exchange is currently holding. These two shouldn't be mixed up and equalised in a non-transparent way to be equal to a specific value in $. With this you could get shenanigens like equalizing a clients funds to $X and swapping their actual holdings for an equivalent of $X valued in exchange token K. Continued after introduction of***[2]***;\n\n\n\n#**P2.**\n\n\nSpeaks for itself. Can be achieved through the use of merkle trees. \n\n\nHowever: as I'm personally not an expert on the ins-outs and all possible restrictions\/exploitations of merkle trees and their implementations and more importantly I believe the best solution***[2]*** as far as on-chain solvency goes has as much transparency as possible whilst preserving client privacy I'll propose an alternative \"dumb-processing\" solution: \n\n\nAs KYC is forced practically on all CEX's with liquidity these days: \nGive every client a unique identifier. This identifier(q) is only shared with the auditors and the client in question. \n\nSplit the balance of every client between multiple, unique, anonymous ID(a)'s. Only give the information of which combination of ID(a)'s make out the balance of a specific client to this client and the auditors. The total amount of all these pseudo-anonymous ID's combined should be the bare minimum of funds contained in the wallets an exchange claims as theirs. This way you can preserve client privacy whilst making the entirety of client holdings public. The split of funds per client per ID and the ID's themselves should be randomized every snapshot to prevent external parties from being able to gain information about specific clients or their trades from these balances. \n\n(Possibly forcing token\/coin dust below a certain value to get unique ID's seperate from the other parts of a clients balance might be a way to prevent unique dust combinations disclosing more information than required. Might have to exclude dust below a certain value entirely(The client name, other than the unique identifier(q) tied to the account, would preferrably be encrypted before sending it over to the auditor to prevent an auditor leak from leaking client names+holdings)). \n\n\nMake the exchange publically push a list of this information on chain at the same time as it is sent to auditors. (this information being all ID(a)'s and their respective balances)\nAfter the auditors publish the version of this information they received from the exchange it guarantees the information the auditors got\/are getting is the same as the information publically disclosed.\nThe auditors can verify no clients have the same ID's and no funds are allocated more than once. \n\n\nIn addition to this you would use a 2FA system, that changes code every X seconds that also keeps a history list of previously generated codes. Once again, it is vital that this is outside the exchanges control. \n\n\nEvery single trade executed by a client would have to be approved by a 2FA code. Doing this would ensure that the data presented by the exchange is truthful as otherwise they can be proven to be lying on short notice:\n\n\n**Scenario 1: Exchange lies to both the auditor(s) and the client:**\n\n\nThe exchange lies to both the auditor and customer, reducing the amount of funds the customer has or is supposed to have(or even simply changing them even if the value at moment X is supposed to be equal; XETH swapped for XFTT would be an example), the customer can find in the logs that the exchange has pushed onchain when this happened. The customer can than request proof that permission has been given to execute this trade by requesting the exchange to verify the 2FA code that was supposedly used to grant permission for the trade with a third party: once again a decentralised oracle solution would be preferred to perform these checks and validations to ensure fairness, making use of zero knowledge proofs to prevent the exchange from ever learning what the actual code was). The exchange would not have the correct 2FA code as the customer never entered it. The exchange is proven to have been lying. An accompanying smart contract can trigger a circuitbreaker: either halting all trades\/deposits\/withdrawals or doing something previously agreed upon. (Might want to use on-chain storage for an (encrypted) history list of generated codes.)\n\n\n\n\n**Scenario 2: Exchange lies to 1 party**\n\n\nIf the exchange lies to only the client(s) or only the auditors by providing them with faked data the discrepancy between the data received&amp;published by the auditors and the data pushed onchain by the exchange would become immediately visible, once again allowing a circuit breaker to be triggered. \n\n\n\n\n#**P3.**\n\n\n\nTo ensure this you need to publicize what the exchange puts on the assets part of the equation. If the clients are not happy with this they can withdraw: if FTX had clearly shown it was reliant on FTT being $X to remain solvent I imagine the gap in their balance would have been noticed a lot sooner and the damage could have been a lot smaller. This can be a problem for yield farming\/lending services that are leveraged: they can be stop-loss hunted to force liquidations. For an exchange that shouldn't be touching a clients funds without permission in the first place this shouldn't be a problem.\n\nThings like throwing negative balances into the mix when using merkle trees to make up for missing client funds also becomes impossible with this model as everyone can see that the exchange has included an ID with a negative balance in their publically visible list, even before the auditors even come into play.\n\nOnce again, a smartcontract based circuitbreaker can come into play here by freezing all withdrawals\/deposits\/trades when #clientfundsdeposited\/held&lt;#clientfundsheldonexchangewallets. How fast this is will be depending on how often the lists are updated, however as soon as they're updated and shown to be uncercollaterised a full stop can be triggered minimizing the damage done.\n\nLast it is not possible to completely, 100% mathematically, trustlessly prove off&amp;onchain solvency due to the nature of offchain debts and possibility to simply not disclose part of them to an auditor. It is fraudulent but something being illegal does not make it impossible. This can be mitigated by making it illegal for debtors demand client funds or exchanges to pay debts\/secure loans using client funds. This means either new laws have to be written or the interpretation of certain laws need to be broadened, depending on the country the exchange is active in. This would ensure however that in case of a bankruptcy the clients are minimally impacted.\n\nIdeally you would want a real time check being possible at all times of assets and liabilities. Onchain this is possible, offchain this is much more difficult. This is part of the reason why you would want to try to bring offchain liabilities onchain.\n\nExternal Offchain liability verifications (not tokenized debts to banks for example) are a bit more difficult and I think a periodic checkup by multiple independent auditing firms is as good as it's going to get.\n\nIn the time between these audits, as expecting a full off-chain debt analysis audit to be proven every 10 minutes or so is currently not feasible, we should be doing and expecting what can be done: ensuring the on-chain collateral matches what is owed to the clients. Even if there are external offchain debts(to not-clients), as long as there is a legally binding agreement that making clients whole always precedes repayment of these debts, proving the onchain collateral will take us very far into the direction of where we would ideally want to be, as customers of cex's. \n\n\nI'm not sure whether to call this a model of dual or triple proofs as every single part, the multiple auditors, the onchain public publication seperate from these auditors, the possibility of 2FA check on every trade executed and using a decentralised oracle network to aggregate data&amp;perform external checks is born out of necessity to minimize the chance of fraud by exchanges going unseen until suddenly the gap in their balance sheet is in the billions. Perhaps a part of the 2FA checks and or comparing the list published by the exchange to the list available from the auditors should be automated to be less reliant on customers actually checking these things themselves. \n\nA weakness in this system without this would be that it is relying on customers to actually check every so often whether their balances have not been altered without their permission. By not directly reducing the current market value in fiat of a customers account but by swapping their holdings in the audit for an illiquid token valued at $X a customer wouldn't necessary have to notice it without checking the publicized lists themselves. If none of the customers do this, changes to their balances without their permission could go unnoticed. Making the rest of the system irrelevant as we would be back to step 1: ensuring that the data that is audited and compared to detect fraud has not been falsified. \n\n\nFor all these checks and aggregations a decentralised oracle network is needed. There is no point in going through all the effort of implementing these checks if they are relying on a single point of failure; an oracle that can be manipulated or lied to. As chainlink is currently with leaps and bounds the #1 decentralised oracle provider, working together with their team to implement a system like this would be the logical thing to do. Once again: aggregating the information from the multiple auditors and comparing it to the information published by the exchange itself and the 2FA \"truth-authentication\" checks should all be done through a decentralised oracle service to prevent singular points of trust and therefore becoming exploitable. Whilst you could use it to put the part of the information gained directly from the exchange onchain aswell I think it would be unnecessary as letting the exchange do this themselves would amount to the same: they can't lie without being found out. \n(I\"ll refer to the data directly put onchain by the exchange as E1 and the data aggregated from the auditors as A1 from now on).\n\n\n\n#**Concluding** \n\nWith these implementations we have finally gotten to the true value Proof of Reserves can add: checking at small time intervals whether the datasheets A1 and E1 match. Preferrably even comparing the submitted 2FA auth. codes from the exchanges perspective to what they're suppose to be(zero knowledge proofs). \n\nIn case A1\/E1 do not match with either the 2FA codes and\/or eachother an automated action can be set in motion. Whether this be automatic withdrawal of client funds to wallets whitelisted by clients in advance or triggering a full deposit\/withdrawal\/trading stop or something else entirely. A yearly or quaterly auditor would not save your funds as a client without this as FTX has once again clearly demonstrated: they were solvent according to their auditors in 2020 and 2021. \n\nThere will be some timelag between a funds-gap coming into being and it becoming public as doing the encryption for these lists, being fed through both the auditors systems and being published on chain, then having the data be aggregated and compared can't be instant. However with this model we can decrease the time between audits to a time amount that is currently unfeasible; even if it only were to happen once every couple of hours it would make it incredibly hard and\/or exceedingly obvious for exchanges to play hot potato with funds(or lack thereof). This would do away with a possible need for time-equalised snapshots between exchanges. \n\n**This would guarantee solvency not just at the moment of the audit, once a year or so, but solvency around the clock.** Which is exactly what you would want from a proof of solvency: a guarantee that you have not been bamboozled out of your holdings. \n\n\n\n\nI won't go into the exact technical details behind a possible implementation (https calls, Api implementations and so on ); I'll leave it to vitalik\/link&amp;co to figure it out and implement it. If you want to read more about this topic itself there's a paper that goes a bit deeper into the current issues with proof of solvency you can find here; Broken Proofs of Solvency in Blockchain Custodial Wallets and Exchanges : https:\/\/eprint.iacr.org\/2022\/043.pdf (I would always recommend looking up the paper yourself to prevent possible pdf exploits). \n\n#**TL:DR; The True value of Proof of Reserves is not just proving that at moment X company Y is solvent. FTX was solvent in 2020 and 2021 according to their auditors.**\n\nThe true value lies in guaranteeing that at any which moment in real-time company Y becomes either insolvent or seemingly insolvent you can safeguard the vast majority of client funds. This is achieved by building in a smartcontract with a circuit breaker that can do multiple things; withdraw client funds to an adress that client has whitelisted in advance, stop all trades\/deposits\/withdrawals or something else entirely with the end result being safeguarding the funds of clients held by an exchange as much as possible. A yearly or quarterly audit would not save your funds as a client without this. In order for a circuit breaker such as this to be triggered, regardless of circumstances, a third party, decentralised oracle solution is required. Through these oracles at the very least the off-chain liabilities of an exchange in the form of what they owe to their clients that have funds deposited with them, need to be brought onchain\/be made transparent to this network. \n\nThis guarantees that if the company ever becomes unable to pay the clients what they are owed, even if only by a tiny fraction, the damage is minimized. In order to do this and guarantee it works when it needs to work you need to bring these off-chain liabilities(clients&amp;what they are owed) onchain.\n\n\n\nNone of the current implementations exchanges use guarantee solvency around the clock without relying on the proven to be unreliable words \"trust us\". All of their current implementations do nothing for you as a client as solvency at one specific moment, without further declaring liabilities and so on is meaningless. \n\n\nAs a client you need to keep in mind that even with a system such as the one outlined above implemented you are still responsible for your owns funds. If you accept a company using their own token as collateral to stay solvent you are sabotaging yourself. Accepting this could very well mean an exchange can circumvent all the safeguards above, depending on the implementation of the system in place. As we've seen time and time again, most recently with FTX,Luna,Celsius: trusting an exchange to stay solvent based on the valuation of their own token has proven not to be a great idea. The system outlined above would only expose it being done.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z7x2ok\/trustminimizing_proof_of_solvency_safe_cex\/","author":"ChadRezzarTTV","num_comments":0,"created_utc":1669735626000,"edited":null,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"Trust-Minimizing Proof of Solvency &amp; Safe Cex Requirements","distinguished":null,"id":"z7x2ok","downs":null,"ups":null}

{"subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","score":5,"selftext":"Edit: I'm going to rephrase the question to provide a bit more clarity. DCA would eventually make you money if the underlying asset has value and it is poised to keep going up. What evidence do you have that crypto as an asset would keep going up in value so that DCA would make financial sense?\n\n\nThis question is mostly meant for understanding how investors think when investing in an asset like crypto.\n\nI understand how dollar cost averaging works with traditional assets such as stocks. I DCA into several index funds and some individual stocks that I believe would perform well over the next few years. These stocks however, are connected strongly to companies that provide products and services that are necessary for survival or at least in very high demand. Even if a majority of companies in the S&amp;P 500 are not doing well temporarily, the index fund will eventually keep going up because the services and products provided by these companies will always be used by a vast majority of the population.\n\nI cannot say the same about crypto. I think the technology behind crypto is very amazing but to me, crypto does not provide any real value as an asset. It seems like all of it is based on individuals and entities agreeing to trust the value of crypto currency and agree it as a form of payment for goods and services. Once that trust is removed, crypto is worth nothing.\n\nWith the massive instability of crypto value exacerbated by scams like FTX, lack of regulation and process to prevent or handle scams, investor trust in crypto is eroding. Without an asset or a service that is necessary and used by a vast majority of the population, the only way the crypto value would rise is by newer investors buying at high price. If you're DCAing right now, are you DCAing in the hopes that other people would eventually start DCAing causing the price to go up? Are you waiting for another bull run? If yes, do you have any evidence that the bull run would happen? \n\nI understand my post may be very ignorant and I may be missing something very fundamental. I'm here to educate myself on how and why people invest in crypto.","permalink":"\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/z84xfl\/what_evidence_do_you_guys_have_that_dca_would\/","author":"ronyjk22","num_comments":52,"created_utc":1669753280000,"edited":1669754801000.0,"stickied":false,"link_flair_text":"DISCUSSION","title":"What evidence do you guys have that DCA would work with crypto?","distinguished":null,"id":"z84xfl","downs":null,"ups":null}

Since the FTX collapse, withdrawals from these accounts have been blocked, launching speculation that this claim was dishonest.
